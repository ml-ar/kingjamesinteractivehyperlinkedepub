<span class="verse" id="E11_1">1&#160;</span>And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_2">2&#160;</span>Having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in long garments, in the temple of the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_3">3&#160;</span>And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_4">4&#160;</span>And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_5">5&#160;</span>According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_6">6&#160;</span>Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_7">7&#160;</span>And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves: these things were given of the king’s allowance, according as he promised, to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_8">8&#160;</span>And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_9">9&#160;</span>And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_10">10&#160;</span>And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in very comely order according to the kindreds, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_11">11&#160;</span>And according to the several dignities of the fathers, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_12">12&#160;</span>And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and pans with a good savour, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_13">13&#160;</span>And set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_14">14&#160;</span>For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_15">15&#160;</span>The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias, and Jeduthun, who was of the king’s retinue. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_16">16&#160;</span>Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_17">17&#160;</span>Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they might hold the passover, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_18">18&#160;</span>And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_19">19&#160;</span>So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_20">20&#160;</span>And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_21">21&#160;</span>Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_22">22&#160;</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_23">23&#160;</span>And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart full of godliness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_24">24&#160;</span>As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_25">25&#160;</span>Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_26">26&#160;</span>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_27">27&#160;</span>I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_28">28&#160;</span>Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_29">29&#160;</span>But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_30">30&#160;</span>Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_31">31&#160;</span>Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father’s sepulchre. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_32">32&#160;</span>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_33">33&#160;</span>These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_34">34&#160;</span>And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_35">35&#160;</span>And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_36">36&#160;</span>And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_37">37&#160;</span>The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_38">38&#160;</span>And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_39">39&#160;</span>Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_40">40&#160;</span>Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_41">41&#160;</span>Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_42">42&#160;</span>But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_43">43&#160;</span>And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_44">44&#160;</span>And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_45">45&#160;</span>So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_46">46&#160;</span>And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_47">47&#160;</span>And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_48">48&#160;</span>And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_49">49&#160;</span>The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_50">50&#160;</span>Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_51">51&#160;</span>But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_52">52&#160;</span>So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_53">53&#160;</span>Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_54">54&#160;</span>And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_55">55&#160;</span>As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_56">56&#160;</span>And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E11_57">57&#160;</span>Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy: </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_1">1&#160;</span>In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord might be accomplished, that he had promised by the mouth of Jeremy; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_2">2&#160;</span>The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also by writing, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_3">3&#160;</span>Saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord of Israel, the most high Lord, hath made me king of the whole world, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E12_4">4&#160;</span>And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_5">5&#160;</span>If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel: for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_6">6&#160;</span>Whosoever then dwell in the places about, let them help him, those, I say, that are his neighbours, with gold, and with silver, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_7">7&#160;</span>With gifts, with horses, and with cattle, and other things, which have been set forth by vow, for the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_8">8&#160;</span>Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and to build an house for the Lord at Jerusalem, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_9">9&#160;</span>And they that dwelt round about them, and helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many free gifts of a great number whose minds were stirred up thereto. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_10">10&#160;</span>King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_11">11&#160;</span>Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_12">12&#160;</span>And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_13">13&#160;</span>And this was the number of them; A thousand golden cups, and a thousand of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and a thousand other vessels. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_14">14&#160;</span>So all the vessels of gold and of silver, which were carried away, were five thousand four hundred threescore and nine. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_15">15&#160;</span>These were brought back by Sanabassar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_16">16&#160;</span>But in the time of Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus, and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, and Semellius the secretary, with others that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto him against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these letters following; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_17">17&#160;</span>To king Artexerxes our lord, Thy servants, Rathumus the storywriter, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Celosyria and Phenice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_18">18&#160;</span>Be it now known to the lord king, that the Jews that are up from you to us, being come into Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city, do build the marketplaces, and repair the walls of it and do lay the foundation of the temple. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_19">19&#160;</span>Now if this city and the walls thereof be made up again, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but also rebel against kings. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_20">20&#160;</span>And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_21">21&#160;</span>But to speak unto our lord the king, to the intent that, if it be thy pleasure it may be sought out in the books of thy fathers: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shalt understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_23">23&#160;</span>And that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always wars therein; for the which cause even this city was made desolate. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore now we do declare unto thee, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, thou shalt from henceforth have no passage into Celosyria and Phenice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_25">25&#160;</span>Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the storywriter, to Beeltethmus, to Semellius the scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and dwellers in Samaria and Syria and Phenice, after this manner; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_26">26&#160;</span>I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: therefore I commanded to make diligent search, and it hath been found that that city was from the beginning practising against kings; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_27">27&#160;</span>And the men therein were given to rebellion and war: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tributes in Celosyria and Phenice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_28">28&#160;</span>Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be no more done in it; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_29">29&#160;</span>And that those wicked workers proceed no further to the annoyance of kings, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E12_30">30&#160;</span>Then king Artexerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop of horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='E13_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E13_1">1&#160;</span>Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E13_3">3&#160;</span>And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E13_10">10&#160;</span>The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E13_13">13&#160;</span>Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E13_14">14&#160;</span>And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers; </div>

<span class="verse" id="E18_42">42&#160;</span>But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_43">43&#160;</span>Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_44">44&#160;</span>And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan, Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_45">45&#160;</span>And I bade them that they should go unto Saddeus the captain, who was in the place of the treasury: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_46">46&#160;</span>And commanded them that they should speak unto Daddeus, and to his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the priests’ office in the house of the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_47">47&#160;</span>And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto us skilful men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_48">48&#160;</span>And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother, of the sons of Channuneus, and their sons, were twenty men. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_49">49&#160;</span>And of the servants of the temple whom David had ordained, and the principal men for the service of the Levites to wit, the servants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue of whose names were shewed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_50">50&#160;</span>And there I vowed a fast unto the young men before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and them that were with us, for our children, and for the cattle: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_51">51&#160;</span>For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and horsemen, and conduct for safeguard against our adversaries. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_52">52&#160;</span>For we had said unto the king, that the power of the Lord our God should be with them that seek him, to support them in all ways. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_53">53&#160;</span>And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, and found him favourable unto us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_54">54&#160;</span>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_55">55&#160;</span>And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his council, and the princes, and all Israel, had given. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_56">56&#160;</span>And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_57">57&#160;</span>And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_58">58&#160;</span>And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_59">59&#160;</span>Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_60">60&#160;</span>So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silver and the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, into the temple of the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_61">61&#160;</span>And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord, which was with us: and from the beginning of our journey the Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_62">62&#160;</span>And when we had been there three days, the gold and silver that was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_63">63&#160;</span>And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban, Levites: all was delivered them by number and weight. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_64">64&#160;</span>And all the weight of them was written up the same hour. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_65">65&#160;</span>Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offered sacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E18_66">66&#160;</span>Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_67">67&#160;</span>And they delivered the king’s commandments unto the king’s stewards’ and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; and they honoured the people and the temple of God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_68">68&#160;</span>Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_69">69&#160;</span>The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_70">70&#160;</span>For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the great men have been partakers of this iniquity. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_71">71&#160;</span>And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_72">72&#160;</span>So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_73">73&#160;</span>Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_74">74&#160;</span>I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_75">75&#160;</span>For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_76">76&#160;</span>For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and are in great sin, even unto this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_77">77&#160;</span>And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_78">78&#160;</span>And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_79">79&#160;</span>And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_80">80&#160;</span>Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_81">81&#160;</span>Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewry and Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_82">82&#160;</span>And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? for we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_83">83&#160;</span>That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_84">84&#160;</span>Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_85">85&#160;</span>Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye may leave the inheritance of the land unto your children for evermore. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_86">86&#160;</span>And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_87">87&#160;</span>And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned back again to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with the uncleanness of the nations of the land. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_88">88&#160;</span>Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_89">89&#160;</span>O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_90">90&#160;</span>Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_91">91&#160;</span>And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_92">92&#160;</span>Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the nations of the land, and now is all Israel aloft. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_93">93&#160;</span>Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away all our wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their children, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E18_94">94&#160;</span>Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law of the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_95">95&#160;</span>Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E18_96">96&#160;</span>So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so they sware.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='E19_0'> 9</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E19_1">1&#160;</span>Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib, </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E19_10">10&#160;</span>Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E19_11">11&#160;</span>But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E19_12">12&#160;</span>Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed, </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E19_14">14&#160;</span>Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them. </div>
