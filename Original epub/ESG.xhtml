<span class="verse" id="EG10_4">4&#160;</span>Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_5">5&#160;</span>For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_6">6&#160;</span>A little fountain became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_7">7&#160;</span>And the two dragons are I and Aman. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_8">8&#160;</span>And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_9">9&#160;</span>And my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_10">10&#160;</span>Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_11">11&#160;</span>And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of judgment, before God among all nations. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_12">12&#160;</span>So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG10_13">13&#160;</span>Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, according to the generations for ever among his people.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="EG11_1">1&#160;</span>In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had interpreted it. </div>
<div class='s'>[PLACED IN THE GREEK BEFORE CHAP. 1.1 OF THE HEBREW] </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_2">2&#160;</span>In the second year of the reign of Artexerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the son of Jairus, the son of Semei, the son of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_3">3&#160;</span>Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the king’s court. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_4">4&#160;</span>He was also one of the captives, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Judea; and this was his dream: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_5">5&#160;</span>Behold a noise of a tumult, with thunder, and earthquakes, and uproar in the land: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_6">6&#160;</span>And, behold, two great dragons came forth ready to fight, and their cry was great. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_7">7&#160;</span>And at their cry all nations were prepared to battle, that they might fight against the righteous people. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_8">8&#160;</span>And lo a day of darkness and obscurity, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great uproar, upon earth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_9">9&#160;</span>And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own evils, and were ready to perish. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_10">10&#160;</span>Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much water. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_11">11&#160;</span>The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the glorious. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG11_12">12&#160;</span>Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what God had determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know it.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='EG12_0'> 12</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_1">1&#160;</span>And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_2">2&#160;</span>And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artexerxes the king; and so he certified the king of them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_3">3&#160;</span>Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed it, they were strangled. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_4">4&#160;</span>And the king made a record of these things, and Mardocheus also wrote thereof. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_5">5&#160;</span>So the king commanded, Mardocheus to serve in the court, and for this he rewarded him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG12_6">6&#160;</span>Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus the Agagite, who was in great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_2">2&#160;</span>After that I became lord over many nations and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_3">3&#160;</span>Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_4">4&#160;</span>Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us cannot go forward. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_5">5&#160;</span>Seeing then we understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange manner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmly established: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_6">6&#160;</span>Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year: </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_14">14&#160;</span>But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God, neither will I do it in pride. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EG13_15">15&#160;</span>And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy the inheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning. </div>
