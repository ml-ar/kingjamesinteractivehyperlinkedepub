# Interactive Annotated King James Version EPUB

An project to build an EPUB for the 1769 standardization of the King James Version, with marginal notes for the OT and NT taken from the Cambridge Parallel Bible, and marginal notes from Scrivener's Paragraph Bible for the apocrypha.

## There are so many e-bibles. Why a new one?

The King James Version contained many marginal notes that gave alternate translations or referenced other verses. This project is to consolidate all those notes into an EPUB (an open standard for ebooks) and to make the verse references interactive hyperlinks, facilitating navigation and study.

## How do I put this on my e-reader?

An EPUB is literally just a zip file that contains certain folders and files with certain names. Because this is a work in progress (it needs to be proofread for typos and for correct/working links), it would be inconvenient for me to zip and unzip a file every single time.

If you're reading this, I'm sure it's in your ability to find out where exactly in this repo the EPUB structure is contained (check git diffs for clues if you're really stuck, but it shouldn't be that hard to figure out). If not, contact me at mikhail.archer@proton.me, send me $10, and I'll send you an EPUB that you just drag and drop onto your e-reader.

## I've found an error/typo.
