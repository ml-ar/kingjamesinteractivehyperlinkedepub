# Interactive Annotated King James Version EPUB

A project to build an EPUB for the 1769 standardization of the King James Version, with marginal notes for the OT and NT taken from the Cambridge Parallel Bible, and marginal notes from Scrivener's Paragraph Bible for the apocrypha.

## There are so many e-bibles. Why a new one?

The King James Version contained many marginal notes that gave alternate translations or referenced other verses. This project is to consolidate all those notes into an EPUB (an open standard for ebooks) and to make the verse references interactive hyperlinks, facilitating navigation and study.

The Bible was written in a language very different from English, so it is inevitable that there will be uncertainties in interpretation. Many of the notes are alternate translations, assisting English readers with study and understanding. 

However, the Bible also contains many cross-references which are not immediately obvious and, in fact, can be quite confusing if the reader has forgotten his history (as stiff-necked sinners are wont to do). For example, the books of the chronicles describes events almost entirely through genealogical lists. 1 Chronicles 7:12 references mentions "sons of Aher." Who is this Aher, his sons, and why are they important? The marginal note for this passage references Numbers 26:38; in this e-book, simply click on the footnote, then on the chapter:verse link to take you directly to the cross-reference.

## How do I put this on my e-reader?

An EPUB is literally just a zip file that contains certain folders and files with certain names. Because this is a work in progress (it needs to be proofread for typos and for correct/working links), it would be inconvenient for me to zip and unzip a file every single time.

If you're reading this, I'm sure it's in your ability to find out where exactly in this repo the EPUB structure is contained (check git diffs for clues if you're really stuck, but it shouldn't be that hard to figure out). If not, contact me at mikhail.archer@proton.me, send me $10, and I'll send you an EPUB that you just drag and drop onto your e-reader.

##EPUB doesn't work on my e-reader.

I recommend Calibre to do e-book conversions. For best results with an Amazon kindle, convert to the AZW3 format (not MOBI).

## I've found an error/typo.
