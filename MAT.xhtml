<span class="verse" id="MT1_1">1&#160;</span> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_2">2&#160;</span> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_3">3&#160;</span> And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_4">4&#160;</span> And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_5">5&#160;</span> And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_6">6&#160;</span> And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <span class='add'>that had been the wife</span> of Urias; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_7">7&#160;</span> And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_8">8&#160;</span> And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_9">9&#160;</span> And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_10">10&#160;</span> And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_11">11&#160;</span> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_12">12&#160;</span> And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_13">13&#160;</span> And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_14">14&#160;</span> And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_15">15&#160;</span> And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_16">16&#160;</span> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_17">17&#160;</span> So all the generations from Abraham to David <span class='add'>are</span> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon <span class='add'>are</span> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ <span class='add'>are</span> fourteen generations. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT1_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_19">19&#160;</span> Then Joseph her husband, being a just <span class='add'>man</span>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_20">20&#160;</span> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_21">21&#160;</span> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_22">22&#160;</span> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_23">23&#160;</span> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_24">24&#160;</span> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 
<span class="verse" id="MT1_25">25&#160;</span> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='MT2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT2_1">1&#160;</span> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_2">2&#160;</span> Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_3">3&#160;</span> When Herod the king had heard <span class='add'>these things</span>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_4">4&#160;</span> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_5">5&#160;</span> And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_6">6&#160;</span> And thou Bethlehem, <span class='add'>in</span> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_7">7&#160;</span> Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_8">8&#160;</span> And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <span class='add'>him</span>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_9">9&#160;</span> When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_10">10&#160;</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT2_11">11&#160;</span>¶ And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_12">12&#160;</span> And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_13">13&#160;</span> And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_14">14&#160;</span> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_15">15&#160;</span> And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT2_16">16&#160;</span>¶ Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_17">17&#160;</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_18">18&#160;</span> In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping <span class='add'>for</span> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT2_19">19&#160;</span>¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_20">20&#160;</span> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_21">21&#160;</span> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_22">22&#160;</span> But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: 
<span class="verse" id="MT2_23">23&#160;</span> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='MT3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT3_1">1&#160;</span> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_2">2&#160;</span> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_3">3&#160;</span> For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_4">4&#160;</span> And the same John had his raiment of camel’s  hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_5">5&#160;</span> Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_6">6&#160;</span> And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT3_7">7&#160;</span>¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_8">8&#160;</span> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_9">9&#160;</span> And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <span class='add'>our</span> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_10">10&#160;</span> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_11">11&#160;</span> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <span class='add'>with</span> fire: 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_12">12&#160;</span> Whose fan <span class='add'>is</span> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT3_13">13&#160;</span>¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_14">14&#160;</span> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_15">15&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto him, <span class='wj'> Suffer <span class='add'> it to be so</span> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</span> Then he suffered him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_16">16&#160;</span> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 
<span class="verse" id="MT3_17">17&#160;</span> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='MT4_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT4_1">1&#160;</span> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_2">2&#160;</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_3">3&#160;</span> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_4">4&#160;</span> But he answered and said, <span class='wj'> It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_5">5&#160;</span> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_6">6&#160;</span> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in <span class='add'>their</span> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_7">7&#160;</span> Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_8">8&#160;</span> Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_9">9&#160;</span> And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_10">10&#160;</span> Then saith Jesus unto him, <span class='wj'> Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_11">11&#160;</span> Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT4_12">12&#160;</span>¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_13">13&#160;</span> And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_14">14&#160;</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_15">15&#160;</span> The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, <span class='add'>by</span> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_16">16&#160;</span> The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT4_17">17&#160;</span>¶ From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class='wj'> Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT4_18">18&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_19">19&#160;</span> And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_20">20&#160;</span> And they straightway left <span class='add'>their</span> nets, and followed him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_21">21&#160;</span> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James <span class='add'>the son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_22">22&#160;</span> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT4_23">23&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_24">24&#160;</span> And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. 
<span class="verse" id="MT4_25">25&#160;</span> And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and <span class='add'>from</span> Decapolis, and <span class='add'>from</span> Jerusalem, and <span class='add'>from</span> Judaea, and <span class='add'>from</span> beyond Jordan.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='MT5_0'> 5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT5_1">1&#160;</span> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_2">2&#160;</span> And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="MT5_8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Blessed are ye, when <span class='add'>men</span> shall revile you, and persecute <span class='add'>you</span>, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great <span class='add'>is</span> your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT5_13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT5_14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</span>

<span class="verse" id="MT27_12">12&#160;</span> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_13">13&#160;</span> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_14">14&#160;</span> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_15">15&#160;</span> Now at <span class='add'>that</span> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_16">16&#160;</span> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_17">17&#160;</span> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_18">18&#160;</span> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_19">19&#160;</span>¶ When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_20">20&#160;</span> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_21">21&#160;</span> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_22">22&#160;</span> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? <span class='add'>They</span> all say unto him, Let him be crucified. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_23">23&#160;</span> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_24">24&#160;</span>¶ When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but <span class='add'>that</span> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed <span class='add'>his</span> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye <span class='add'>to it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_25">25&#160;</span> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <span class='add'>be</span> on us, and on our children. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_26">26&#160;</span>¶ Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <span class='add'>him</span> to be crucified. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_27">27&#160;</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <span class='add'>of soldiers</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_28">28&#160;</span> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_29">29&#160;</span>¶ And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <span class='add'>it</span> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_30">30&#160;</span> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_31">31&#160;</span> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <span class='add'>him</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_32">32&#160;</span> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_33">33&#160;</span> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_34">34&#160;</span>¶ They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted <span class='add'>thereof</span>, he would not drink. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_35">35&#160;</span> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_36">36&#160;</span> And sitting down they watched him there; 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_37">37&#160;</span> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_38">38&#160;</span> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_39">39&#160;</span>¶ And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_40">40&#160;</span> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <span class='add'>it</span> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_41">41&#160;</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking <span class='add'>him</span>, with the scribes and elders, said, 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_42">42&#160;</span> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_43">43&#160;</span> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_44">44&#160;</span> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_45">45&#160;</span> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_46">46&#160;</span> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class='wj'> Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</span> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_47">47&#160;</span> Some of them that stood there, when they heard <span class='add'>that</span>, said, This <span class='add'>man</span> calleth for Elias. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_48">48&#160;</span> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled <span class='add'>it</span> with vinegar, and put <span class='add'>it</span> on a reed, and gave him to drink. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_49">49&#160;</span> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_50">50&#160;</span>¶ Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_51">51&#160;</span> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_52">52&#160;</span> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_53">53&#160;</span> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_54">54&#160;</span> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_55">55&#160;</span> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_56">56&#160;</span> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_57">57&#160;</span> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_58">58&#160;</span> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_59">59&#160;</span> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_60">60&#160;</span> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_61">61&#160;</span> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT27_62">62&#160;</span>¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_63">63&#160;</span> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_64">64&#160;</span> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_65">65&#160;</span> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <span class='add'>it</span> as sure as ye can. 
<span class="verse" id="MT27_66">66&#160;</span> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='MT28_0'> 28</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT28_1">1&#160;</span> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_2">2&#160;</span> And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_3">3&#160;</span> His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_4">4&#160;</span> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <span class='add'>men</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_5">5&#160;</span> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_6">6&#160;</span> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_7">7&#160;</span> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_8">8&#160;</span> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT28_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class='wj'> All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_10">10&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto them, <span class='wj'> Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT28_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_12">12&#160;</span> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_13">13&#160;</span> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <span class='add'>away</span> while we slept. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_14">14&#160;</span> And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_15">15&#160;</span> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT28_16">16&#160;</span>¶ Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_17">17&#160;</span> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_18">18&#160;</span> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <span class='wj'> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MT28_19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span> 
<span class="verse" id="MT28_20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <span class='add'>even</span> unto the end of the world.</span> Amen. </div><div class="footnote">
