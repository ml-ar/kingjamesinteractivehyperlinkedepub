Icarus, to the saints who minister eBible.org:

Grace, peace, and mercy exceeding be to you from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

Attached you will find some part of my efforts. In this e-book, every marginal note to be found in the Old Testament of the original 1611 Authorized Version has a home (even the notes that are not found therein, demarcated with square brackets [], which were included in The Parallel Bible, published by Oxford University Press in 1885, and which explain some of the differences between translating from archaic English to standard English). They are demarcated throughout the text according to their symbols found in the 1611 edition, even according to their proper positions therein.

Now little bit on my methodology: my efforts have revealed to me what has been already apparently well-studied by others (https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-7-no-2-2006/chapters-verses-punctuation-spelling-italics-king-james-version)â€”to wit, typographical differences, mostly in punctuation and proper nouns, between different publications of the Authorized Version. (Is it Adonizedek or Adoni-zedec? threshingfloor or threshing-floor? etc.) In such discrepancies, I have mostly deferred to the original 1611 edition except in cases where it concerns our maddeningly unstandardized English spellings, in which cases I have preferred the modern renderings (in particular, "threshingfloor" becomes "threshing floor" according to the division of compound words in the 1611 but not according to the spelling). (You may perform a diff on the .xhtml files included in the attached epub with that already found on your website.)
