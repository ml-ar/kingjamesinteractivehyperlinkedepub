Icarus, to the saints who minister eBible.org:

Grace, peace, and mercy exceeding be to you from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

I pray you exhibit most godly longsuffering to me, in that I have taken so long to reply. But life and the matter concerning which I wrote you in the first place have proved more vexing than I had initially anticipated. Howbeit, through the grace of God, I have been granted continuance in both—and, in the latter, some promise. (I would not as yet be impudent enough to ask for the same benevolence in the former.)

Attached you will find the Genesis of my project:

1.txt (SHA-256 hash: b471b32f8596243205277e4b66dd62993767c7c3541722dd4e540fc78a9215dc): Decrypt, and rename the file to "GEN.xhtml" (no quotation marks). You can then view it somewhat acceptably in a normal web browser; but, to see it in its full glory, take the original eng-kjv.epub (King James Version + Apocrypha) found on your website, change its extension to .zip, navigate therein, go to the folder OEBPS, and replace the existing file of the same name with this one, then behold the entirety with the EPUB viewer of your choice. Every marginal note to be found in Genesis of the original 1611 Authorized Version has a home herein (even the notes that are not found therein, demarcated with square brackets [], which were included in The Parallel Bible, published by Oxford University Press in 1885, and which explain some of the differences between transliterating from archaic English to modern English); they are demarcated throughout the text according to their symbols found in the 1611 edition, even according to their proper positions therein.

2.txt (SHA-256 hash: 25d9c31f2ff4e404e0f404ea73930a1df2a8703e4e8164a508b9d3d4e3bc98b3): Decrypt, and rename to "content.opf". As I mentioned in my previous communication, the order of the books of the apocrypha in your original eng-kjv.epub did not match the order of the Apocrypha found in the original 1611 edition. However, this was quite easy to fix. This file also belongs in the OEBPS folder already mentioned.

3.txt (SHA-256 hash: aa7bdecf2cfd6f2532b9eb4f0a32d2c719b0763aea74d50e53b4ded6d6436fc0): Decrypt, and rename as index.xhtml. Serves the same purpose as that mentioned above: this also belongs in the OEBPS folder.

4.txt (SHA-256 hash: 890c1be12ec482bb68e555b02f56799401e18b4d30c6580a99175a67c57a6269): My updated public key.

(In your previous epistle you mentioned Haiola. I briefly looked into it, however I found it too difficult to install and use. Therefore, I worked only with your EPUB: web development has always been a mystery to me, but the form of the xhtmls of the EPUB wasn't wholly incomprehensible.)

I ask that you join me in my prayers for my sin—namely, the sin of ambition, for I now lust to multiply functionality to that which I've already mentioned previously (and from my life experience I know all too well the frustration and despair God inflicts upon one for ambition): Many of the marginal notes—even all those that are missing in the Old Testament of your original eng-kjv.epub—are cross references. For example, the very first marginal note in the very first verse of the very first book reads "Ps. 33. 6. & 136. 5. Acts 14. 15. & 17. 24. Heb. 11. 3."—and would it not be a marvelous thing, if in that single note there were five separate hyperlinks, each one directing to the appropriate place?

Of course, I am not so brutish as to be undertaking this project by hand, in the manner of monks before Gutenberg. I've found a somewhat well-organized source for the Old and New Testaments and have built a parser to extract them—it's just a matter of correcting for the typographical differences between said source and the text of the EPUB. Unfortunately, the source I found for the Apocrypha is formatted somewhat differently, so I will have to build a new parser for it which will require a not inconsequential amount of time.

I write you to thank you again for your resource—and to ask if you or any of your brethren are or would be interested in my work. I, of course, have undertaken this project for the purpose of prosperity—though I hasten to add that I conflate not the material with the spiritual, that I am not so blind as to go a whoring after such idols as filthy lucre (and, at any rate, through experience I've learned that the printed word is a horrible vehicle for the pursuit thereof); I hope to seek prosperity in its purest sense, whether that be through my own satisfaction of having a nice e-book, of doing God's work, of learning new technologies, of whetting my skills, and of making new connections. Therefore, if you or anyone you know would like to have a discussion concerning all this, you have the keys and contact information of,

Who am grateful to you for the work already done so that I should be able to pursue my own,
Icarus Newton


P.S. A little on my methodology: my efforts have revealed to me what has been already well-studied by others apparently (https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-7-no-2-2006/chapters-verses-punctuation-spelling-italics-king-james-version)—to wit, typographical differences, mostly in punctuation and proper nouns, between different publications of the Authorized Version. (e.g., Is it Adonizedek or Adoni-zedec? threshingfloor or threshing-floor? etc.) In such discrepancies, I have mostly deferred to the typography of the original 1611 edition except in cases where it concerns our maddeningly unstandardized English spellings, in the which I have preferred the modern renderings (e.g., "threshingfloor" and "threshing-floor" become "threshing floor" according to the division of compound words in the 1611 but not according to the spelling thereof).

P.P.S. I am curious to know as to how, in the marginal notes in the original e-book found on your site, the fact that the footnote symbols appear only at the end of the verse (as opposed to where they appear in the original 1611 edition and, by extension, where they occur in my files) is countervailed by the fact that the text of the footnote itself is preceded by the text of the verse the footnote pertains to (e.g., in Genesis 1:4, the marginal note is "Heb. between the light and between the darkness" but the composer of the e-book on your website helpfully renders it as "the light from…: Heb. between the light and between the darkness") so that the reader should know what part of the verse it's referring to. Would your brethren know how this was achieved? Surely it was not done by hand?
