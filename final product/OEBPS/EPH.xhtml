<span class="verse" id="EP1_1">1&#160;</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_2">2&#160;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ. </div>

<span class="verse" id="EP1_3">3&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <a href='#FN1' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a><span class='add'>places</span> in Christ:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_4">4&#160;</span> According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_5">5&#160;</span> Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
<span class="verse" id="EP1_6">6&#160;</span> To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
<span class="verse" id="EP1_7">7&#160;</span> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
<span class="verse" id="EP1_8">8&#160;</span> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
<span class="verse" id="EP1_9">9&#160;</span> Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he <a href='#FN2' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>‡</a>hath purposed in himself:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_10">10&#160;</span> That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in <a href='#FN3' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a>heaven, and which are on earth; <span class='add'>even</span> in him:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_11">11&#160;</span> In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_12">12&#160;</span> That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first <a href='#FN4' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>trusted in Christ.
<span class="verse" id="EP1_13">13&#160;</span> In whom ye also <span class='add'>trusted</span>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
<span class="verse" id="EP1_14">14&#160;</span> Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EP1_15">15&#160;</span> Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

<span class="verse" id="EP1_17">17&#160;</span> That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation <a href='#FN5' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>in the knowledge of him:

<span class="verse" id="EP1_19">19&#160;</span> And what <span class='add'>is</span> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working <a href='#FN6' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a>of his mighty power,
<span class="verse" id="EP1_20">20&#160;</span> Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <span class='add'>him</span> at his own right hand in the heavenly <span class='add'>places</span>,
<span class="verse" id="EP1_21">21&#160;</span> Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
<span class="verse" id="EP1_22">22&#160;</span> And hath put all <span class='add'>things</span> under his feet, and gave him <span class='add'>to be</span> the head over all <span class='add'>things</span> to the church,
<span class="verse" id="EP1_23">23&#160;</span> Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EP2_1">1&#160;</span> And you <span class='add'>hath he quickened</span>, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_2">2&#160;</span> Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_3">3&#160;</span> Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling <a href='#FN7' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a>the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_4">4&#160;</span> But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
<span class="verse" id="EP2_5">5&#160;</span> Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
<span class="verse" id="EP2_6">6&#160;</span> And hath raised <span class='add'>us</span> up together, and made <span class='add'>us</span> sit together in heavenly <span class='add'>places</span> in Christ Jesus:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_7">7&#160;</span> That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in <span class='add'>his</span> kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_8">8&#160;</span> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: <span class='add'>it is</span> the gift of God:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_9">9&#160;</span> Not of works, lest any man should boast.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_10">10&#160;</span> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before <a href='#FN8' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>ordained that we should walk in them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EP2_11">11&#160;</span> Wherefore remember, that ye <span class='add'>being</span> in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_12">12&#160;</span> That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_13">13&#160;</span> But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_14">14&#160;</span> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition <span class='add'>between us</span>;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_15">15&#160;</span> Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, <span class='add'>even</span> the law of commandments <span class='add'>contained</span> in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, <span class='add'>so</span> making peace;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_16">16&#160;</span> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity <a href='#FN9' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>thereby:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_17">17&#160;</span> And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_18">18&#160;</span> For through him we both have <a href='#FN10' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>‡</a>access by one Spirit unto the Father.
<span class="verse" id="EP2_19">19&#160;</span> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_20">20&#160;</span> And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner <span class='add'>stone</span>;
<span class="verse" id="EP2_21">21&#160;</span> In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
<span class="verse" id="EP2_22">22&#160;</span> In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='EP3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EP3_1">1&#160;</span> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
<span class="verse" id="EP3_2">2&#160;</span> If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
<span class="verse" id="EP3_3">3&#160;</span> How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote <a href='#FN11' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>afore in few words,
<span class="verse" id="EP3_4">4&#160;</span> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
<span class="verse" id="EP3_5">5&#160;</span> Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
<span class="verse" id="EP3_6">6&#160;</span> That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
<span class="verse" id="EP3_7">7&#160;</span> Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
<span class="verse" id="EP3_8">8&#160;</span> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
<span class="verse" id="EP3_9">9&#160;</span> And to make all <span class='add'>men</span> see what <span class='add'>is</span> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
<span class="verse" id="EP3_10">10&#160;</span> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <span class='add'>places</span> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
<span class="verse" id="EP3_11">11&#160;</span> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
<span class="verse" id="EP3_12">12&#160;</span> In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

<span class="verse" id="EP4_2">2&#160;</span> With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;

<span class="verse" id="EP4_4">4&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;

<span class="verse" id="EP4_7">7&#160;</span> But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
<span class="verse" id="EP4_8">8&#160;</span> Wherefore he saith, <a href='#FN13' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a>When he ascended up on high, he led <a href='#FN14' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
<span class="verse" id="EP4_9">9&#160;</span>(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?

<span class="verse" id="EP4_13">13&#160;</span> Till we all come <a href='#FN17' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the <a href='#FN18' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>stature of the fulness of Christ:
<span class="verse" id="EP4_14">14&#160;</span> That we <span class='add'>henceforth</span> be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, <span class='add'>and</span> cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

<span class="verse" id="EP5_3">3&#160;</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
<span class="verse" id="EP5_4">4&#160;</span> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_5">5&#160;</span> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_6">6&#160;</span> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of <a href='#FN28' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>disobedience.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_7">7&#160;</span> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_8">8&#160;</span> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <span class='add'>are ye</span> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
<span class="verse" id="EP5_9">9&#160;</span>(For the fruit of the Spirit <span class='add'>is</span> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
<span class="verse" id="EP5_10">10&#160;</span> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

<span class="verse" id="EP5_12">12&#160;</span> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_13">13&#160;</span> But all things that are <a href='#FN29' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>∥</a>reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

<span class="verse" id="EP5_18">18&#160;</span> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
<span class="verse" id="EP5_19">19&#160;</span> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
<span class="verse" id="EP5_20">20&#160;</span> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<span class="verse" id="EP5_21">21&#160;</span> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_22">22&#160;</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_23">23&#160;</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_24">24&#160;</span> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <span class='add'>let</span> the wives <span class='add'>be</span> to their own husbands in every thing.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_25">25&#160;</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
<span class="verse" id="EP5_26">26&#160;</span> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
<span class="verse" id="EP5_27">27&#160;</span> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_28">28&#160;</span> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_29">29&#160;</span> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
<span class="verse" id="EP5_30">30&#160;</span> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_31">31&#160;</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_32">32&#160;</span> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
<span class="verse" id="EP5_33">33&#160;</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <span class='add'>see</span> that she reverence <span class='add'>her</span> husband.  </div>
