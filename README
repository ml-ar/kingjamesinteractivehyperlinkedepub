This branch is for verifying the validity of the notes in notesonlyfromhtml[ampersandspreservedspansmodified]; feed the file into footnoteparser.awk, check for verification errors, fix them where appropriate (spelling errors) and then add the appropriate xhtml book files when done

This branch's version of footnoteparser.awk is authoritative.
