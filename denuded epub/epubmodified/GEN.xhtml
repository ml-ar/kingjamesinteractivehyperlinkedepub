<span class="verse" id="GN1_1">1&#160;</span> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_2">2&#160;</span> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <span class='add'>was</span> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_3">3&#160;</span> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_4">4&#160;</span> And God saw the light, that <span class='add'>it was</span> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_5">5&#160;</span> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_6">6&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_7">7&#160;</span> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which <span class='add'>were</span> under the firmament from the waters which <span class='add'>were</span> above the firmament: and it was so. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_8">8&#160;</span> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry <span class='add'>land</span> appear: and it was so. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_10">10&#160;</span> And God called the dry <span class='add'>land</span> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that <span class='add'>it was</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_11">11&#160;</span> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, <span class='add'>and</span> the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed <span class='add'>is</span> in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_12">12&#160;</span> And the earth brought forth grass, <span class='add'>and</span> herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed <span class='add'>was</span> in itself, after his kind: and God saw that <span class='add'>it was</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_13">13&#160;</span> And the evening and the morning were the third day.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_14">14&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
<span class="verse" id="GN1_15">15&#160;</span> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_16">16&#160;</span> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: <span class='add'>he made</span> the stars also.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_17">17&#160;</span> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_18">18&#160;</span> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that <span class='add'>it was</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_19">19&#160;</span> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_20">20&#160;</span> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl <span class='add'>that</span> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_21">21&#160;</span> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that <span class='add'>it was</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_22">22&#160;</span> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_23">23&#160;</span> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_25">25&#160;</span> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that <span class='add'>it was</span> good. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_26">26&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_27">27&#160;</span> So God created man in his <span class='add'>own</span> image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
<span class="verse" id="GN1_28">28&#160;</span> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN1_29">29&#160;</span>¶ And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which <span class='add'>is</span> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which <span class='add'>is</span> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_30">30&#160;</span> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein <span class='add'>there is</span> life, <span class='add'>I have given</span> every green herb for meat: and it was so.
<span class="verse" id="GN1_31">31&#160;</span> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <span class='add'>it was</span> very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_1">1&#160;</span> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_2">2&#160;</span> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_3">3&#160;</span> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_4">4&#160;</span>¶ These <span class='add'>are</span> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God made the earth and the heavens, 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_5">5&#160;</span> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <span class='add'>there was</span> not a man to till the ground. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_6">6&#160;</span> But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_7">7&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God formed man <span class='add'>of</span> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_9">9&#160;</span> And out of the ground made the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_10">10&#160;</span> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_11">11&#160;</span> The name of the first <span class='add'>is</span> Pison: that <span class='add'>is</span> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <span class='add'>there is</span> gold; 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_12">12&#160;</span> And the gold of that land <span class='add'>is</span> good: there <span class='add'>is</span> bdellium and the onyx stone. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_13">13&#160;</span> And the name of the second river <span class='add'>is</span> Gihon: the same <span class='add'>is</span> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_14">14&#160;</span> And the name of the third river <span class='add'>is</span> Hiddekel: that <span class='add'>is</span> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river <span class='add'>is</span> Euphrates.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_15">15&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_16">16&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
<span class="verse" id="GN2_17">17&#160;</span> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_18">18&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God said, <span class='add'>It is</span> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_19">19&#160;</span> And out of the ground the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <span class='add'>them</span> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <span class='add'>was</span> the name thereof.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_20">20&#160;</span> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN2_21">21&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_22">22&#160;</span> And the rib, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_23">23&#160;</span> And Adam said, This <span class='add'>is</span> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
<span class="verse" id="GN2_24">24&#160;</span> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
<span class="verse" id="GN2_25">25&#160;</span> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_1">1&#160;</span> Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
<span class="verse" id="GN3_2">2&#160;</span> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_3">3&#160;</span> But of the fruit of the tree which <span class='add'>is</span> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_4">4&#160;</span> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_5">5&#160;</span> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_6">6&#160;</span> And when the woman saw that the tree <span class='add'>was</span> good for food, and that it <span class='add'>was</span> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <span class='add'>one</span> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
<span class="verse" id="GN3_7">7&#160;</span> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <span class='add'>were</span> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
<span class="verse" id="GN3_8">8&#160;</span> And they heard the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God amongst the trees of the garden.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_9">9&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <span class='add'>art</span> thou? 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_10">10&#160;</span> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <span class='add'>was</span> naked; and I hid myself. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_11">11&#160;</span> And he said, Who told thee that thou <span class='add'>wast</span> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_12">12&#160;</span> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <span class='add'>to be</span> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_13">13&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God said unto the woman, What <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_14">14&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <span class='add'>art</span> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_15">15&#160;</span> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_16">16&#160;</span> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <span class='add'>shall be</span> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_17">17&#160;</span> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <span class='add'>of</span> it all the days of thy life; 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_18">18&#160;</span> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
<span class="verse" id="GN3_19">19&#160;</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <span class='add'>art</span>, and unto dust shalt thou return. 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_20">20&#160;</span> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
<span class="verse" id="GN3_21">21&#160;</span> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God make coats of skins, and clothed them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN3_22">22&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_23">23&#160;</span> Therefore the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 
<span class="verse" id="GN3_24">24&#160;</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN4_1">1&#160;</span> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="GN4_2">2&#160;</span> And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN4_3">3&#160;</span> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="GN4_4">4&#160;</span> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
<span class="verse" id="GN4_5">5&#160;</span> But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN4_6">6&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN4_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Cain, Where <span class='add'>is</span> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <span class='add'>Am</span> I my brother’s keeper? 
<span class="verse" id="GN4_10">10&#160;</span> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.

<span class="verse" id="GN4_15">15&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN4_16">16&#160;</span>¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_19">19&#160;</span> And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that <span class='add'>were</span> her father’s.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_25">25&#160;</span>¶ Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_26">26&#160;</span> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives <span class='add'>taken</span> with the sword? 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_27">27&#160;</span> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
<span class="verse" id="GN31_28">28&#160;</span> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in <span class='add'>so</span> doing. 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_29">29&#160;</span> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_34">34&#160;</span> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found <span class='add'>them</span> not.
<span class="verse" id="GN31_35">35&#160;</span> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women <span class='add'>is</span> upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. </div>

<span class="verse" id="GN31_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What <span class='add'>is</span> my trespass? what <span class='add'>is</span> my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_37">37&#160;</span> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set <span class='add'>it</span> here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_44">44&#160;</span> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_45">45&#160;</span> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up <span class='add'>for</span> a pillar.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_48">48&#160;</span> And Laban said, This heap <span class='add'>is</span> a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_49">49&#160;</span> And Mizpah; for he said, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
<span class="verse" id="GN31_50">50&#160;</span> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take <span class='add'>other</span> wives beside my daughters, no man <span class='add'>is</span> with us; see, God <span class='add'>is</span> witness betwixt me and thee. 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_51">51&#160;</span> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold <span class='add'>this</span> pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_52">52&#160;</span> This heap <span class='add'>be</span> witness, and <span class='add'>this</span> pillar <span class='add'>be</span> witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
<span class="verse" id="GN31_53">53&#160;</span> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

<span class="verse" id="GN31_55">55&#160;</span> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="GN32_7">7&#160;</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <span class='add'>was</span> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
<span class="verse" id="GN32_8">8&#160;</span> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN32_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 
<span class="verse" id="GN32_10">10&#160;</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN32_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

<span class="verse" id="GN32_18">18&#160;</span> Then thou shalt say, <span class='add'>They be</span> thy servant Jacob’s; it <span class='add'>is</span> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <span class='add'>is</span> behind us. 
<span class="verse" id="GN32_19">19&#160;</span> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

<span class="verse" id="GN32_21">21&#160;</span> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 
<span class="verse" id="GN32_22">22&#160;</span> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

<span class="verse" id="GN40_17">17&#160;</span> And in the uppermost basket <span class='add'>there was</span> of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
<span class="verse" id="GN40_18">18&#160;</span> And Joseph answered and said, This <span class='add'>is</span> the interpretation thereof: The three baskets <span class='add'>are</span> three days: 
<span class="verse" id="GN40_19">19&#160;</span> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN40_20">20&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass the third day, <span class='add'>which was</span> Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
<span class="verse" id="GN40_21">21&#160;</span> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 
<span class="verse" id="GN40_22">22&#160;</span> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
<span class="verse" id="GN40_23">23&#160;</span> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN41_0'>41</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_2">2&#160;</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_3">3&#160;</span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <span class='add'>other</span> kine upon the brink of the river. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_4">4&#160;</span> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_5">5&#160;</span> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_6">6&#160;</span> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_7">7&#160;</span> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <span class='add'>it was</span> a dream. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_8">8&#160;</span> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <span class='add'>there was</span> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_9">9&#160;</span>¶ Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_10">10&#160;</span> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, <span class='add'>both</span> me and the chief baker: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_11">11&#160;</span> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_12">12&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_13">13&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_14">14&#160;</span>¶ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <span class='add'>himself</span>, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_15">15&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <span class='add'>there is</span> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <span class='add'>that</span> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_16">16&#160;</span> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <span class='add'>It is</span> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_17">17&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_18">18&#160;</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_19">19&#160;</span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_20">20&#160;</span> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_21">21&#160;</span> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <span class='add'>were</span> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_22">22&#160;</span> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_23">23&#160;</span> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <span class='add'>and</span> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
<span class="verse" id="GN41_24">24&#160;</span> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <span class='add'>this</span> unto the magicians; but <span class='add'>there was</span> none that could declare <span class='add'>it</span> to me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_25">25&#160;</span>¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <span class='add'>is</span> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <span class='add'>is</span> about to do. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_26">26&#160;</span> The seven good kine <span class='add'>are</span> seven years; and the seven good ears <span class='add'>are</span> seven years: the dream <span class='add'>is</span> one. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_27">27&#160;</span> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <span class='add'>are</span> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_28">28&#160;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <span class='add'>is</span> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_29">29&#160;</span> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_30">30&#160;</span> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_31">31&#160;</span> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <span class='add'>shall be</span> very grievous.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_32">32&#160;</span> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <span class='add'>it is</span> because the thing <span class='add'>is</span> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_33">33&#160;</span> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_34">34&#160;</span> Let Pharaoh do <span class='add'>this</span>, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_35">35&#160;</span> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_36">36&#160;</span> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_37">37&#160;</span>¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_38">38&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <span class='add'>such a one</span> as this <span class='add'>is</span>, a man in whom the Spirit of God <span class='add'>is</span>? 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_39">39&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <span class='add'>there is</span> none so discreet and wise as thou <span class='add'>art:</span> 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_40">40&#160;</span> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_41">41&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_42">42&#160;</span> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
<span class="verse" id="GN41_43">43&#160;</span> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <span class='add'>ruler</span> over all the land of Egypt.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_44">44&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <span class='add'>am</span> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_45">45&#160;</span> And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <span class='add'>all</span> the land of Egypt.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_46">46&#160;</span>¶ And Joseph <span class='add'>was</span> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_47">47&#160;</span> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_48">48&#160;</span> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <span class='add'>was</span> round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_49">49&#160;</span> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <span class='add'>it was</span> without number. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_50">50&#160;</span> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_51">51&#160;</span> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <span class='add'>said he</span>, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_52">52&#160;</span> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN41_53">53&#160;</span>¶ And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_54">54&#160;</span> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_55">55&#160;</span> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
<span class="verse" id="GN41_56">56&#160;</span> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
<span class="verse" id="GN41_57">57&#160;</span> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <span class='add'>corn;</span> because that the famine was <span class='add'>so</span> sore in all lands.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN42_0'>42</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN42_1">1&#160;</span> Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_2">2&#160;</span> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN42_3">3&#160;</span>¶ And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_4">4&#160;</span> But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_5">5&#160;</span> And the sons of Israel came to buy <span class='add'>corn</span> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_6">6&#160;</span> And Joseph <span class='add'>was</span> the governor over the land, <span class='add'>and</span> he <span class='add'>it was</span> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him <span class='add'>with</span> their faces to the earth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN42_7">7&#160;</span> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
<span class="verse" id="GN42_8">8&#160;</span> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_9">9&#160;</span> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_10">10&#160;</span> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_11">11&#160;</span> We <span class='add'>are</span> all one man’s sons; we <span class='add'>are</span> true <span class='add'>men</span>, thy servants are no spies.

<span class="verse" id="GN42_13">13&#160;</span> And they said, Thy servants <span class='add'>are</span> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest <span class='add'>is</span> this day with our father, and one <span class='add'>is</span> not. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_14">14&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto them, That <span class='add'>is it</span> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> spies: 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_15">15&#160;</span> Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_16">16&#160;</span> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <span class='add'>there be any</span> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <span class='add'>are</span> spies.
<span class="verse" id="GN42_17">17&#160;</span> And he put them all together into ward three days.
<span class="verse" id="GN42_18">18&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; <span class='add'>for</span> I fear God: 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_19">19&#160;</span>If ye <span class='add'>be</span> true <span class='add'>men</span>, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_20">20&#160;</span> But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN42_21">21&#160;</span>¶ And they said one to another, We <span class='add'>are</span> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_22">22&#160;</span> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_23">23&#160;</span> And they knew not that Joseph understood <span class='add'>them;</span> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

<span class="verse" id="GN42_25">25&#160;</span>¶ Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_26">26&#160;</span> And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_27">27&#160;</span> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it <span class='add'>was</span> in his sack’s mouth. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_28">28&#160;</span> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <span class='add'>it is</span> even in my sack: and their heart failed <span class='add'>them</span>, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> God hath done unto us?</div>

<span class="verse" id="GN42_29">29&#160;</span>¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN42_35">35&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money <span class='add'>was</span> in his sack: and when <span class='add'>both</span> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
<span class="verse" id="GN42_36">36&#160;</span> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <span class='add'>of my children:</span> Joseph <span class='add'>is</span> not, and Simeon <span class='add'>is</span> not, and ye will take Benjamin <span class='add'>away:</span> all these things are against me.

<span class="verse" id="GN43_20">20&#160;</span> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
<span class="verse" id="GN43_21">21&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <span class='add'>every</span> man’s money <span class='add'>was</span> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_22">22&#160;</span> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_23">23&#160;</span> And he said, Peace <span class='add'>be</span> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
<span class="verse" id="GN43_24">24&#160;</span> And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave <span class='add'>them</span> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_25">25&#160;</span> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. </div>

<span class="verse" id="GN43_27">27&#160;</span> And he asked them of <span class='add'>their</span> welfare, and said, <span class='add'>Is</span> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <span class='add'>Is</span> he yet alive?
<span class="verse" id="GN43_28">28&#160;</span> And they answered, Thy servant our father <span class='add'>is</span> in good health, he <span class='add'>is</span> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_29">29&#160;</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, <span class='add'>Is</span> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_30">30&#160;</span> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <span class='add'>where</span> to weep; and he entered into <span class='add'>his</span> chamber, and wept there. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_31">31&#160;</span> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_32">32&#160;</span> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <span class='add'>is</span> an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_33">33&#160;</span> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 
<span class="verse" id="GN43_34">34&#160;</span> And he took <span class='add'>and sent</span> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='GN44_0'>44</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN44_1">1&#160;</span> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks <span class='add'>with</span> food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
<span class="verse" id="GN44_2">2&#160;</span> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_3">3&#160;</span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

<span class="verse" id="GN44_5">5&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not this <span class='add'>it</span> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</div>

<span class="verse" id="GN44_7">7&#160;</span> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_8">8&#160;</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_9">9&#160;</span> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_10">10&#160;</span> And he said, Now also <span class='add'>let</span> it <span class='add'>be</span> according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_11">11&#160;</span> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_12">12&#160;</span> And he searched, <span class='add'>and</span> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_13">13&#160;</span> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="GN44_14">14&#160;</span>¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he <span class='add'>was</span> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_15">15&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto them, What deed <span class='add'>is</span> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
<span class="verse" id="GN44_16">16&#160;</span> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?

<span class="verse" id="GN44_17">17&#160;</span> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: <span class='add'>but</span> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. </div>

<span class="verse" id="GN44_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou <span class='add'>art</span> even as Pharaoh. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_19">19&#160;</span> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

<span class="verse" id="GN44_25">25&#160;</span> And our father said, Go again, <span class='add'>and</span> buy us a little food. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_26">26&#160;</span> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother <span class='add'>be</span> with us. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_27">27&#160;</span> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two <span class='add'>sons:</span>

<span class="verse" id="GN44_30">30&#160;</span> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad <span class='add'>be</span> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;

<span class="verse" id="GN44_32">32&#160;</span> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_33">33&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
<span class="verse" id="GN44_34">34&#160;</span> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad <span class='add'>be</span> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</div>

<span class="verse" id="GN45_3">3&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I <span class='add'>am</span> Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
<span class="verse" id="GN45_4">4&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I <span class='add'>am</span> Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
