<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="EC1_1">1&#160;</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_2">2&#160;</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <span class='add'>is</span> vanity. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_3">3&#160;</span> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC1_4">4&#160;</span> <span class='add'>One</span> generation passeth away, and <span class='add'>another</span> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_5">5&#160;</span> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
<span class="verse" id="EC1_6">6&#160;</span> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_7">7&#160;</span> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <span class='add'>is</span> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
<span class="verse" id="EC1_8">8&#160;</span> All things <span class='add'>are</span> full of labour; man cannot utter <span class='add'>it:</span> the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC1_9">9&#160;</span>The thing that hath been, it <span class='add'>is that</span> which shall be; and that which is done <span class='add'>is</span> that which shall be done: and <span class='add'>there is</span> no new <span class='add'>thing</span> under the sun. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_10">10&#160;</span> Is there <span class='add'>any</span> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <span class='add'>is</span> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_11">11&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> no remembrance of former <span class='add'>things;</span> neither shall there be <span class='add'>any</span> remembrance of <span class='add'>things</span> that are to come with <span class='add'>those</span> that shall come after. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC1_12">12&#160;</span>¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_13">13&#160;</span> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <span class='add'>things</span> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
<span class="verse" id="EC1_14">14&#160;</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_15">15&#160;</span> <span class='add'>That which is</span> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
<span class="verse" id="EC1_16">16&#160;</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <span class='add'>they</span> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
<span class="verse" id="EC1_17">17&#160;</span> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="EC1_18">18&#160;</span> For in much wisdom <span class='add'>is</span> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth  sorrow.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='EC2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC2_1">1&#160;</span> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_2">2&#160;</span> I said of laughter, <span class='add'>It is</span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_3">3&#160;</span> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <span class='add'>was</span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_4">4&#160;</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_5">5&#160;</span> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <span class='add'>kind of</span> fruits: 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_6">6&#160;</span> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_7">7&#160;</span> I got <span class='add'>me</span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
<span class="verse" id="EC2_8">8&#160;</span> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <span class='add'>as</span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_9">9&#160;</span> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_10">10&#160;</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_11">11&#160;</span> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <span class='add'>was</span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <span class='add'>there was</span> no profit under the sun. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC2_12">12&#160;</span>¶ And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <span class='add'>can</span> the man <span class='add'>do</span> that cometh after the king? <span class='add'>even</span> that which hath been already done.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_13">13&#160;</span> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_14">14&#160;</span> The wise man’s eyes <span class='add'>are</span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_15">15&#160;</span> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_16">16&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>there is</span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <span class='add'>is</span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <span class='add'>man</span>? as the fool. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC2_17">17&#160;</span> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun <span class='add'>is</span> grievous unto me: for all <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC2_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_19">19&#160;</span> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <span class='add'>man</span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <span class='add'>is</span> also vanity. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_20">20&#160;</span> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_21">21&#160;</span> For there is a man whose labour <span class='add'>is</span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <span class='add'>for</span> his portion. This also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and a great evil.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_22">22&#160;</span> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_23">23&#160;</span> For all his days <span class='add'>are</span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC2_24">24&#160;</span>¶ <span class='add'>There is</span> nothing better for a man, <span class='add'>than</span> that he should eat and drink, and <span class='add'>that</span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <span class='add'>was</span> from the hand of God.
<span class="verse" id="EC2_25">25&#160;</span> For who can eat, or who else can hasten <span class='add'>hereunto</span>, more than I? 
<span class="verse" id="EC2_26">26&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>God</span> giveth to a man that <span class='add'>is</span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <span class='add'>him that is</span> good before God. This also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='EC3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC3_1">1&#160;</span>To every <span class='add'>thing there is</span> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_2">2&#160;</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <span class='add'>that which is</span> planted;
<span class="verse" id="EC3_3">3&#160;</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_4">4&#160;</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_5">5&#160;</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
<span class="verse" id="EC3_6">6&#160;</span> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
<span class="verse" id="EC3_7">7&#160;</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_8">8&#160;</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_9">9&#160;</span> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_10">10&#160;</span> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC3_11">11&#160;</span> He hath made every <span class='add'>thing</span> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_12">12&#160;</span> I know that <span class='add'>there is</span> no good in them, but for <span class='add'>a man</span> to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_13">13&#160;</span> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <span class='add'>is</span> the gift of God. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_14">14&#160;</span> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <span class='add'>it</span>, that <span class='add'>men</span> should fear before him. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_15">15&#160;</span> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC3_16">16&#160;</span>¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <span class='add'>that</span> wickedness <span class='add'>was</span> there; and the place of righteousness, <span class='add'>that</span> iniquity <span class='add'>was</span> there. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_17">17&#160;</span> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <span class='add'>there is</span> a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_18">18&#160;</span> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
<span class="verse" id="EC3_19">19&#160;</span> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <span class='add'>is</span> vanity. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_20">20&#160;</span> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
<span class="verse" id="EC3_21">21&#160;</span> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
<span class="verse" id="EC3_22">22&#160;</span> Wherefore I perceive that <span class='add'>there is</span> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <span class='add'>is</span> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='EC4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC4_1">1&#160;</span> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <span class='add'>such as were</span> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <span class='add'>there was</span> power; but they had no comforter.
<span class="verse" id="EC4_2">2&#160;</span> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_3">3&#160;</span> Yea, better <span class='add'>is he</span> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC4_4">4&#160;</span>¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <span class='add'>is</span> also vanity and vexation of spirit.
<span class="verse" id="EC4_5">5&#160;</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_6">6&#160;</span> Better <span class='add'>is</span> an handful <span class='add'>with</span> quietness, than both the hands full <span class='add'>with</span> travail and vexation of spirit. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC4_7">7&#160;</span>¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_8">8&#160;</span> There is one <span class='add'>alone</span>, and <span class='add'>there is</span> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <span class='add'>is there</span> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <span class='add'>saith he</span>, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This <span class='add'>is</span> also vanity, yea, it <span class='add'>is</span> a sore travail. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC4_9">9&#160;</span>¶ Two <span class='add'>are</span> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_10">10&#160;</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <span class='add'>that is</span> alone when he falleth; for <span class='add'>he hath</span> not another to help him up. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_11">11&#160;</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <span class='add'>alone</span>? 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_12">12&#160;</span> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC4_13">13&#160;</span>¶ Better <span class='add'>is</span> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
<span class="verse" id="EC4_14">14&#160;</span> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <span class='add'>he that is</span> born in his kingdom becometh poor. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_15">15&#160;</span> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. 
<span class="verse" id="EC4_16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> no end of all the people, <span class='add'>even</span> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <span class='add'>is</span> vanity and vexation of spirit.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='EC5_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC5_1">1&#160;</span> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_2">2&#160;</span> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter <span class='add'>any</span> thing before God: for God <span class='add'>is</span> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
<span class="verse" id="EC5_3">3&#160;</span> For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice <span class='add'>is known</span> by multitude of words. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC5_4">4&#160;</span> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <span class='add'>he hath</span> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_5">5&#160;</span> Better <span class='add'>is it</span> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_6">6&#160;</span> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <span class='add'>was</span> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_7">7&#160;</span> For in the multitude of dreams and many words <span class='add'>there are</span> also <span class='add'>divers</span> vanities: but fear thou God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC5_8">8&#160;</span>¶ If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <span class='add'>he that is</span> higher than the highest regardeth; and <span class='add'>there be</span> higher than they.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC5_9">9&#160;</span>¶ Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <span class='add'>himself</span> is served by the field. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_10">10&#160;</span> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <span class='add'>is</span> also vanity. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_11">11&#160;</span> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <span class='add'>is there</span> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <span class='add'>of them</span> with their eyes? 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_12">12&#160;</span> The sleep of a labouring man <span class='add'>is</span> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_13">13&#160;</span> There is a sore evil <span class='add'>which</span> I have seen under the sun, <span class='add'>namely</span>, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_14">14&#160;</span> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and <span class='add'>there is</span> nothing in his hand. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_15">15&#160;</span> As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_16">16&#160;</span> And this also <span class='add'>is</span> a sore evil, <span class='add'>that</span> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_17">17&#160;</span> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and <span class='add'>he hath</span> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC5_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Behold <span class='add'>that</span> which I have seen: <span class='add'>it is</span> good and comely <span class='add'>for one</span> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it <span class='add'>is</span> his portion.
<span class="verse" id="EC5_19">19&#160;</span> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this <span class='add'>is</span> the gift of God. 
<span class="verse" id="EC5_20">20&#160;</span> For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth  <span class='add'>him</span> in the joy of his heart.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='EC6_0'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC6_1">1&#160;</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it <span class='add'>is</span> common among men: 
<span class="verse" id="EC6_2">2&#160;</span> A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this <span class='add'>is</span> vanity, and it <span class='add'>is</span> an evil disease. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC6_3">3&#160;</span>¶ If a man beget an hundred <span class='add'>children</span>, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also <span class='add'>that</span> he have no burial; I say, <span class='add'>that</span> an untimely birth <span class='add'>is</span> better than he. 
<span class="verse" id="EC6_4">4&#160;</span> For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. 
<span class="verse" id="EC6_5">5&#160;</span> Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known <span class='add'>any thing:</span> this hath more rest than the other. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC6_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Yea, though he live a thousand years twice <span class='add'>told</span>, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="EC6_7">7&#160;</span> All the labour of man <span class='add'>is</span> for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
<span class="verse" id="EC6_8">8&#160;</span> For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? </div>
