<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="HS1_1">1&#160;</span> The word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <span class='add'>and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS1_2">2&#160;</span> The beginning of the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> by Hosea. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, <span class='add'>departing</span> from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="HS1_3">3&#160;</span> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. 
<span class="verse" id="HS1_4">4&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <span class='add'>while</span>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
<span class="verse" id="HS1_5">5&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS1_6">6&#160;</span>¶ And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And <span class='add'>God</span> said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
<span class="verse" id="HS1_7">7&#160;</span> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS1_8">8&#160;</span>¶ Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
<span class="verse" id="HS1_9">9&#160;</span> Then said <span class='add'>God</span>, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye <span class='add'>are</span> not my people, and I will not be your <span class='add'>God</span>.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS1_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> not my people, <span class='add'>there</span> it shall be said unto them, <span class='add'>Ye are</span> the sons of the living God.
<span class="verse" id="HS1_11">11&#160;</span> Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great <span class='add'>shall be</span> the day of Jezreel.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS2_1">1&#160;</span> Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_2">2&#160;</span> Plead with your mother, plead: for she <span class='add'>is</span> not my wife, neither <span class='add'>am</span> I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_3">3&#160;</span> Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_4">4&#160;</span> And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they <span class='add'>be</span> the children of whoredoms. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_5">5&#160;</span> For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give <span class='add'>me</span> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS2_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_7">7&#160;</span> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find <span class='add'>them:</span> then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then <span class='add'>was it</span> better with me than now. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_8">8&#160;</span> For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, <span class='add'>which</span> they prepared for Baal.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_9">9&#160;</span> Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax <span class='add'>given</span> to cover her nakedness.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_10">10&#160;</span> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_11">11&#160;</span> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_12">12&#160;</span> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These <span class='add'>are</span> my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_13">13&#160;</span> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS2_14">14&#160;</span>¶ Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_15">15&#160;</span> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_16">16&#160;</span> And it shall be at that day, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>that</span> thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.
<span class="verse" id="HS2_17">17&#160;</span> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_18">18&#160;</span> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and <span class='add'>with</span> the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_19">19&#160;</span> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_20">20&#160;</span> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_21">21&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_22">22&#160;</span> And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. 
<span class="verse" id="HS2_23">23&#160;</span> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to <span class='add'>them which were</span> not my people, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> my people; and they shall say, <span class='add'>Thou art</span> my God.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS3_1">1&#160;</span> Then said the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of <span class='add'>her</span> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.
<span class="verse" id="HS3_2">2&#160;</span> So I bought her to me for fifteen <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver, and <span class='add'>for</span> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
<span class="verse" id="HS3_3">3&#160;</span> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <span class='add'>another</span> man: so <span class='add'>will</span> I also <span class='add'>be</span> for thee. 
<span class="verse" id="HS3_4">4&#160;</span> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <span class='add'>without</span> teraphim:
<span class="verse" id="HS3_5">5&#160;</span> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> their God, and David their king; and shall fear the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> and his goodness in the latter days.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS4_1">1&#160;</span> Hear the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, ye children of Israel: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <span class='add'>there is</span> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_2">2&#160;</span> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
<span class="verse" id="HS4_3">3&#160;</span> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_4">4&#160;</span> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people <span class='add'>are</span> as they that strive with the priest. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_5">5&#160;</span> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS4_6">6&#160;</span>¶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
<span class="verse" id="HS4_7">7&#160;</span> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <span class='add'>therefore</span> will I change their glory into shame. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_8">8&#160;</span> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
<span class="verse" id="HS4_9">9&#160;</span> And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
<span class="verse" id="HS4_10">10&#160;</span> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_11">11&#160;</span> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS4_12">12&#160;</span>¶ My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <span class='add'>them</span> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_13">13&#160;</span> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <span class='add'>is</span> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_14">14&#160;</span> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <span class='add'>that</span> doth not understand shall fall.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS4_15">15&#160;</span>¶ Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <span class='add'>yet</span> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_16">16&#160;</span> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will feed them as a lamb in a large place. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_17">17&#160;</span> Ephraim <span class='add'>is</span> joined to idols: let him alone. 
<span class="verse" id="HS4_18">18&#160;</span> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers <span class='add'>with</span> shame do love, Give ye.
<span class="verse" id="HS4_19">19&#160;</span> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS5_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS5_1">1&#160;</span> Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <span class='add'>is</span> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_2">2&#160;</span> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <span class='add'>have been</span> a rebuker of them all.
<span class="verse" id="HS5_3">3&#160;</span> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <span class='add'>and</span> Israel is defiled. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_4">4&#160;</span> They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <span class='add'>is</span> in the midst of them, and they have not known the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="HS5_5">5&#160;</span> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_6">6&#160;</span> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; but they shall not find <span class='add'>him;</span> he hath withdrawn himself from them. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_7">7&#160;</span> They have dealt treacherously against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS5_8">8&#160;</span> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <span class='add'>and</span> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <span class='add'>at</span> Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_9">9&#160;</span> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_10">10&#160;</span> The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <span class='add'>therefore</span> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_11">11&#160;</span> Ephraim <span class='add'>is</span> oppressed  <span class='add'>and</span> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. 
<span class="verse" id="HS5_12">12&#160;</span>Therefore <span class='add'>will</span> I <span class='add'>be</span> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
<span class="verse" id="HS5_13">13&#160;</span> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <span class='add'>saw</span> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
<span class="verse" id="HS5_14">14&#160;</span>For I <span class='add'>will be</span> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <span class='add'>even</span> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <span class='add'>him</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS5_15">15&#160;</span>¶ I will go <span class='add'>and</span> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS6_0'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS6_1">1&#160;</span> Come, and let us return unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
<span class="verse" id="HS6_2">2&#160;</span> After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 
<span class="verse" id="HS6_3">3&#160;</span> Then shall we know, <span class='add'>if</span> we follow on to know the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <span class='add'>and</span> former rain unto the earth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS6_4">4&#160;</span>¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <span class='add'>is</span> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
<span class="verse" id="HS6_5">5&#160;</span> Therefore have I hewed <span class='add'>them</span> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <span class='add'>are as</span> the light <span class='add'>that</span> goeth forth.
<span class="verse" id="HS6_6">6&#160;</span> For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
<span class="verse" id="HS6_7">7&#160;</span> But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
<span class="verse" id="HS6_8">8&#160;</span> Gilead <span class='add'>is</span> a city of them that work iniquity, <span class='add'>and is</span> polluted with blood.
<span class="verse" id="HS6_9">9&#160;</span> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <span class='add'>so</span> the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
<span class="verse" id="HS6_10">10&#160;</span> I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there <span class='add'>is</span> the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
<span class="verse" id="HS6_11">11&#160;</span> Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS7_0'>7</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS7_1">1&#160;</span> When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <span class='add'>and</span> the troop of robbers spoileth without.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_2">2&#160;</span> And they consider not in their hearts <span class='add'>that</span> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_3">3&#160;</span> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 
<span class="verse" id="HS7_4">4&#160;</span>They <span class='add'>are</span> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, <span class='add'>who</span> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_5">5&#160;</span> In the day of our king the princes have made <span class='add'>him</span> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_6">6&#160;</span> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_7">7&#160;</span> They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: <span class='add'>there is</span> none among them that calleth unto me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS7_8">8&#160;</span> Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 
<span class="verse" id="HS7_9">9&#160;</span> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <span class='add'>it</span> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_10">10&#160;</span> And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> their God, nor seek him for all this. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS7_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 
<span class="verse" id="HS7_12">12&#160;</span> When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 
<span class="verse" id="HS7_13">13&#160;</span> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_14">14&#160;</span> And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <span class='add'>and</span> they rebel against me. 
<span class="verse" id="HS7_15">15&#160;</span> Though I have bound <span class='add'>and</span> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
<span class="verse" id="HS7_16">16&#160;</span> They return, <span class='add'>but</span> not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this <span class='add'>shall be</span> their derision in the land of Egypt.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='HS8_0'>8</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="HS8_1">1&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Set</span> the trumpet to thy mouth. <span class='add'>He shall come</span> as an eagle against the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

<span class="verse" id="HS8_4">4&#160;</span> They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <span class='add'>it</span> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. </div>

<span class="verse" id="HS8_5">5&#160;</span>¶ Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <span class='add'>thee</span> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <span class='add'>will it be</span> ere they attain to innocency?
