<span class="verse" id="MC1_1">1&#160;</span> The word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <span class='add'>and</span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="MC1_2">2&#160;</span> Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord <span class='nd'>GOD</span> be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_3">3&#160;</span> For, behold, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="MC1_4">4&#160;</span> And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <span class='add'>and</span> as the waters <span class='add'>that are</span> poured down a steep place.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_5">5&#160;</span> For the transgression of Jacob <span class='add'>is</span> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <span class='add'>is</span> the transgression of Jacob? <span class='add'>is it</span> not Samaria? and what <span class='add'>are</span> the high places of Judah? <span class='add'>are they</span> not Jerusalem? 
<span class="verse" id="MC1_6">6&#160;</span> Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <span class='add'>and</span> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. 
<span class="verse" id="MC1_7">7&#160;</span> And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <span class='add'>it</span> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC1_8">8&#160;</span> Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_9">9&#160;</span> For her wound <span class='add'>is</span> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <span class='add'>even</span> to Jerusalem.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC1_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Declare ye <span class='add'>it</span> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_11">11&#160;</span> Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_12">12&#160;</span> For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto the gate of Jerusalem.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_13">13&#160;</span> O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <span class='add'>is</span> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_14">14&#160;</span> Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib <span class='add'>shall be</span> a lie to the kings of Israel.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_15">15&#160;</span> Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
<span class="verse" id="MC1_16">16&#160;</span> Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="MC2_1">1&#160;</span> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
<span class="verse" id="MC2_2">2&#160;</span> And they covet fields, and take <span class='add'>them</span> by violence; and houses, and take <span class='add'>them</span> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
<span class="verse" id="MC2_3">3&#160;</span> Therefore thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <span class='add'>is</span> evil. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC2_4">4&#160;</span>¶ In that day shall <span class='add'>one</span> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <span class='add'>and</span> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <span class='add'>it</span> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
<span class="verse" id="MC2_5">5&#160;</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC2_6">6&#160;</span> Prophesy ye not, <span class='add'>say they to them that</span> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <span class='add'>that</span> they shall not take shame.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC2_7">7&#160;</span>¶ O <span class='add'>thou that art</span> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> straitened? <span class='add'>are</span> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
<span class="verse" id="MC2_8">8&#160;</span> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
<span class="verse" id="MC2_9">9&#160;</span> The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
<span class="verse" id="MC2_10">10&#160;</span> Arise ye, and depart; for this <span class='add'>is</span> not <span class='add'>your</span> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <span class='add'>you</span>, even with a sore destruction. 
<span class="verse" id="MC2_11">11&#160;</span> If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC2_12">12&#160;</span>¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <span class='add'>the multitude of</span> men. 
<span class="verse" id="MC2_13">13&#160;</span> The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> on the head of them.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='MC3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC3_1">1&#160;</span> And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <span class='add'>Is it</span> not for you to know judgment? 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_2">2&#160;</span> Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_3">3&#160;</span> Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_4">4&#160;</span> Then shall they cry unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC3_5">5&#160;</span>¶ Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_6">6&#160;</span> Therefore night <span class='add'>shall be</span> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
<span class="verse" id="MC3_7">7&#160;</span> Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <span class='add'>there is</span> no answer of God.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC3_8">8&#160;</span>¶ But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_9">9&#160;</span> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 
<span class="verse" id="MC3_10">10&#160;</span> They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<span class="verse" id="MC3_11">11&#160;</span> The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and say, <span class='add'>Is</span> not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> among us? none evil can come upon us.
<span class="verse" id="MC3_12">12&#160;</span> Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <span class='add'>as</span> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='MC4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC4_1">1&#160;</span> But in the last days it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> the mountain of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_2">2&#160;</span> And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> from Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC4_3">3&#160;</span>¶ And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<span class="verse" id="MC4_4">4&#160;</span> But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <span class='add'>them</span> afraid: for the mouth of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_5">5&#160;</span> For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God for ever and ever. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_6">6&#160;</span> In that day, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_7">7&#160;</span> And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC4_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_9">9&#160;</span> Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <span class='add'>is there</span> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_10">10&#160;</span> Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <span class='add'>even</span> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC4_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_12">12&#160;</span> But they know not the thoughts of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. 
<span class="verse" id="MC4_13">13&#160;</span> Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='MC5_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC5_1">1&#160;</span> Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 
<span class="verse" id="MC5_2">2&#160;</span> But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, <span class='add'>though</span> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <span class='add'>yet</span> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <span class='add'>that is</span> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <span class='add'>have been</span> from of old, from everlasting.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_3">3&#160;</span> Therefore will he give them up, until the time <span class='add'>that</span> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC5_4">4&#160;</span>¶ And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, in the majesty of the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_5">5&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>man</span> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_6">6&#160;</span> And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <span class='add'>us</span> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC5_7">7&#160;</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC5_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_9">9&#160;</span> Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. 
<span class="verse" id="MC5_10">10&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: 
<span class="verse" id="MC5_11">11&#160;</span> And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: 
<span class="verse" id="MC5_12">12&#160;</span> And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <span class='add'>more</span> soothsayers: 
<span class="verse" id="MC5_13">13&#160;</span> Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_14">14&#160;</span> And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
<span class="verse" id="MC5_15">15&#160;</span> And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='MC6_0'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC6_1">1&#160;</span> Hear ye now what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
<span class="verse" id="MC6_2">2&#160;</span> Hear ye, O mountains, the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="MC6_3">3&#160;</span> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 
<span class="verse" id="MC6_4">4&#160;</span> For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
<span class="verse" id="MC6_5">5&#160;</span> O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC6_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Wherewith shall I come before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>and</span> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
<span class="verse" id="MC6_7">7&#160;</span> Will the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> be pleased with thousands of rams, <span class='add'>or</span> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <span class='add'>for</span> my transgression, the fruit of my body <span class='add'>for</span> the sin of my soul?
<span class="verse" id="MC6_8">8&#160;</span> He hath shewed thee, O man, what <span class='add'>is</span> good; and what doth the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC6_9">9&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> voice crieth unto the city, and <span class='add'>the man of</span> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC6_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <span class='add'>that is</span> abominable?
<span class="verse" id="MC6_11">11&#160;</span>Shall I count <span class='add'>them</span> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
<span class="verse" id="MC6_12">12&#160;</span> For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <span class='add'>is</span> deceitful in their mouth. 
<span class="verse" id="MC6_13">13&#160;</span>Therefore also will I make <span class='add'>thee</span> sick in smiting thee, in making <span class='add'>thee</span> desolate because of thy sins.

<span class="verse" id="MC6_15">15&#160;</span> Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. </div>

<span class="verse" id="MC6_16">16&#160;</span>¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='MC7_0'>7</div>

<span class="verse" id="MC7_1">1&#160;</span> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <span class='add'>there is</span> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="MC7_3">3&#160;</span>¶ That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <span class='add'>asketh</span> for a reward; and the great <span class='add'>man</span>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
<span class="verse" id="MC7_4">4&#160;</span> The best of them <span class='add'>is</span> as a brier: the most upright <span class='add'>is sharper</span> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <span class='add'>and</span> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. </div>

<span class="verse" id="MC7_10">10&#160;</span>Then <span class='add'>she that is</span> mine enemy shall see <span class='add'>it</span>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
