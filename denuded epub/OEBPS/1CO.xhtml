<div class='mt'>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C11_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="C11_1">1&#160;</span> Paul, called <span class='add'>to be</span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <span class='add'>our</span> brother, 
<span class="verse" id="C11_2">2&#160;</span> Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <span class='add'>to be</span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_3">3&#160;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C11_4">4&#160;</span> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
<span class="verse" id="C11_5">5&#160;</span> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <span class='add'>in</span> all knowledge; 
<span class="verse" id="C11_6">6&#160;</span> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_7">7&#160;</span> So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_8">8&#160;</span> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <span class='add'>that ye may be</span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_9">9&#160;</span> God <span class='add'>is</span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C11_10">10&#160;</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <span class='add'>that</span> there be no divisions among you; but <span class='add'>that</span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_11">11&#160;</span> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <span class='add'>which are of the house</span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_12">12&#160;</span> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_13">13&#160;</span> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 
<span class="verse" id="C11_14">14&#160;</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 
<span class="verse" id="C11_15">15&#160;</span> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_16">16&#160;</span> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_17">17&#160;</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C11_18">18&#160;</span> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_19">19&#160;</span> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_20">20&#160;</span> Where <span class='add'>is</span> the wise? where <span class='add'>is</span> the scribe? where <span class='add'>is</span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 
<span class="verse" id="C11_21">21&#160;</span> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_22">22&#160;</span> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_23">23&#160;</span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 
<span class="verse" id="C11_24">24&#160;</span> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_25">25&#160;</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_26">26&#160;</span> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <span class='add'>are called</span>: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_27">27&#160;</span> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 
<span class="verse" id="C11_28">28&#160;</span> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <span class='add'>yea</span>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_29">29&#160;</span> That no flesh should glory in his presence. 
<span class="verse" id="C11_30">30&#160;</span> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
<span class="verse" id="C11_31">31&#160;</span> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C12_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C12_1">1&#160;</span> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_2">2&#160;</span> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_3">3&#160;</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_4">4&#160;</span> And my speech and my preaching <span class='add'>was</span> not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
<span class="verse" id="C12_5">5&#160;</span> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_6">6&#160;</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: 
<span class="verse" id="C12_7">7&#160;</span> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <span class='add'>even</span> the hidden <span class='add'>wisdom</span>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 
<span class="verse" id="C12_8">8&#160;</span> Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known <span class='add'>it</span>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_9">9&#160;</span> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_10">10&#160;</span> But God hath revealed <span class='add'>them</span> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_11">11&#160;</span> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_12">12&#160;</span> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_13">13&#160;</span> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_14">14&#160;</span> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <span class='add'>them</span>, because they are spiritually discerned. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_15">15&#160;</span> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 
<span class="verse" id="C12_16">16&#160;</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C13_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C13_1">1&#160;</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <span class='add'>even</span> as unto babes in Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_2">2&#160;</span> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <span class='add'>to bear it</span>, neither yet now are ye able. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C13_3">3&#160;</span> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <span class='add'>there is</span> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 
<span class="verse" id="C13_4">4&#160;</span> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <span class='add'>am</span> of Apollos; are ye not carnal? 
<span class="verse" id="C13_5">5&#160;</span> Who then is Paul, and who <span class='add'>is</span> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
<span class="verse" id="C13_6">6&#160;</span> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_7">7&#160;</span> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_8">8&#160;</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_9">9&#160;</span> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, <span class='add'>ye are</span> God’s building. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_10">10&#160;</span> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_11">11&#160;</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_12">12&#160;</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
<span class="verse" id="C13_13">13&#160;</span> Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_14">14&#160;</span> If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_15">15&#160;</span> If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_16">16&#160;</span> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <span class='add'>that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
<span class="verse" id="C13_17">17&#160;</span> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <span class='add'>temple</span> ye are. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C13_18">18&#160;</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_19">19&#160;</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_20">20&#160;</span> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 
<span class="verse" id="C13_21">21&#160;</span> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 
<span class="verse" id="C13_22">22&#160;</span> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
<span class="verse" id="C13_23">23&#160;</span> And ye are Christ’s; and Christ <span class='add'>is</span> God’s.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C14_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C14_1">1&#160;</span> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_2">2&#160;</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_3">3&#160;</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_4">4&#160;</span> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_5">5&#160;</span> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_6">6&#160;</span> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <span class='add'>to</span> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <span class='add'>of men</span> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_7">7&#160;</span> For who maketh thee to differ <span class='add'>from another</span>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <span class='add'>it</span>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <span class='add'>it</span>? 
<span class="verse" id="C14_8">8&#160;</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_9">9&#160;</span> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_10">10&#160;</span> We <span class='add'>are</span> fools for Christ’s sake, but ye <span class='add'>are</span> wise in Christ; we <span class='add'>are</span> weak, but ye <span class='add'>are</span> strong; ye <span class='add'>are</span> honourable, but we <span class='add'>are</span> despised. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_11">11&#160;</span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 
<span class="verse" id="C14_12">12&#160;</span> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: 
<span class="verse" id="C14_13">13&#160;</span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <span class='add'>and are</span> the offscouring of all things unto this day. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_14">14&#160;</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <span class='add'>you</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_15">15&#160;</span> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet <span class='add'>have ye</span> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_16">16&#160;</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_17">17&#160;</span> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_18">18&#160;</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_19">19&#160;</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_20">20&#160;</span> For the kingdom of God <span class='add'>is</span> not in word, but in power. 
<span class="verse" id="C14_21">21&#160;</span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <span class='add'>in</span> the spirit of meekness?  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C15_0'> 5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C15_1">1&#160;</span> It is reported commonly <span class='add'>that there is</span> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_2">2&#160;</span> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_3">3&#160;</span> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <span class='add'>concerning</span> him that hath so done this deed, 
<span class="verse" id="C15_4">4&#160;</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="verse" id="C15_5">5&#160;</span> To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_6">6&#160;</span> Your glorying <span class='add'>is</span> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
<span class="verse" id="C15_7">7&#160;</span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 
<span class="verse" id="C15_8">8&#160;</span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <span class='add'>bread</span> of sincerity and truth. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_9">9&#160;</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 
<span class="verse" id="C15_10">10&#160;</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_11">11&#160;</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. 
<span class="verse" id="C15_12">12&#160;</span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 
<span class="verse" id="C15_13">13&#160;</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='C16_0'> 6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C16_1">1&#160;</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_2">2&#160;</span> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_3">3&#160;</span> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_4">4&#160;</span> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_5">5&#160;</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_6">6&#160;</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_7">7&#160;</span> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <span class='add'>suffer yourselves to</span> be defrauded? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_8">8&#160;</span> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class='add'>your</span> brethren. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_9">9&#160;</span> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
<span class="verse" id="C16_10">10&#160;</span> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_11">11&#160;</span> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C16_12">12&#160;</span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_13">13&#160;</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <span class='add'>is</span> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_14">14&#160;</span> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_15">15&#160;</span> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <span class='add'>them</span> the members of an harlot? God forbid. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_16">16&#160;</span> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_17">17&#160;</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_18">18&#160;</span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
<span class="verse" id="C16_19">19&#160;</span> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <span class='add'>which is</span> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
<span class="verse" id="C16_20">20&#160;</span> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="C17_1">1&#160;</span> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: <span class='add'>It is</span> good for a man not to touch a woman. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_2">2&#160;</span> Nevertheless, <span class='add'>to avoid</span> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_3">3&#160;</span> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_4">4&#160;</span> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_5">5&#160;</span> Defraud ye not one the other, except <span class='add'>it be</span> with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_6">6&#160;</span> But I speak this by permission, <span class='add'>and</span> not of commandment. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_7">7&#160;</span> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C17_8">8&#160;</span> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_9">9&#160;</span> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_10">10&#160;</span> And unto the married I command, <span class='add'>yet</span> not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from <span class='add'>her</span> husband: 
<span class="verse" id="C17_11">11&#160;</span> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to <span class='add'>her</span> husband: and let not the husband put away <span class='add'>his</span> wife. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_12">12&#160;</span> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_13">13&#160;</span> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_14">14&#160;</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_15">15&#160;</span> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <span class='add'>cases</span>: but God hath called us to peace. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_16">16&#160;</span> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save <span class='add'>thy</span> husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save <span class='add'>thy</span> wife? 
<span class="verse" id="C17_17">17&#160;</span> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_18">18&#160;</span> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_19">19&#160;</span> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_20">20&#160;</span> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_21">21&#160;</span> Art thou called <span class='add'>being</span> a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use <span class='add'>it</span> rather. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_22">22&#160;</span> For he that is called in the Lord, <span class='add'>being</span> a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, <span class='add'>being</span> free, is Christ’s servant. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_23">23&#160;</span> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_24">24&#160;</span> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C17_25">25&#160;</span> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_26">26&#160;</span> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, <span class='add'>I say</span>, that <span class='add'>it is</span> good for a man so to be. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_27">27&#160;</span> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_28">28&#160;</span> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_29">29&#160;</span> But this I say, brethren, the time <span class='add'>is</span> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 
<span class="verse" id="C17_30">30&#160;</span> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 
<span class="verse" id="C17_31">31&#160;</span> And they that use this world, as not abusing <span class='add'>it</span>: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_32">32&#160;</span> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
<span class="verse" id="C17_33">33&#160;</span> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please <span class='add'>his</span> wife. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_34">34&#160;</span> There is difference <span class='add'>also</span> between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please <span class='add'>her</span> husband. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_35">35&#160;</span> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_36">36&#160;</span> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of <span class='add'>her</span> age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_37">37&#160;</span> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_38">38&#160;</span> So then he that giveth <span class='add'>her</span> in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth <span class='add'>her</span> not in marriage doeth better. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_39">39&#160;</span> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C17_40">40&#160;</span> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="C18_1">1&#160;</span> Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_2">2&#160;</span> And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_3">3&#160;</span> But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_4">4&#160;</span> As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol <span class='add'>is</span> nothing in the world, and that <span class='add'>there is</span> none other God but one. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_5">5&#160;</span> For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

<span class="verse" id="C18_7">7&#160;</span> Howbeit <span class='add'>there is</span> not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat <span class='add'>it</span> as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_8">8&#160;</span> But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_9">9&#160;</span> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. 
<span class="verse" id="C18_10">10&#160;</span> For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
<span class="verse" id="C18_11">11&#160;</span> And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 
<span class="verse" id="C18_12">12&#160;</span> But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

<span class="verse" id="C19_19">19&#160;</span> For though I be free from all <span class='add'>men</span>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

<span class="verse" id="C111_23">23&#160;</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <span class='add'>same</span> night in which he was betrayed took bread: 
<span class="verse" id="C111_24">24&#160;</span> And when he had given thanks, he brake <span class='add'>it</span>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_25">25&#160;</span> After the same manner also <span class='add'>he took</span> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <span class='add'>it</span>, in remembrance of me. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_26">26&#160;</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_27">27&#160;</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <span class='add'>this</span> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_28">28&#160;</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <span class='add'>that</span> bread, and drink of <span class='add'>that</span> cup. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_29">29&#160;</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.

<span class="verse" id="C111_32">32&#160;</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_33">33&#160;</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 
<span class="verse" id="C111_34">34&#160;</span> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="C112_1">1&#160;</span> Now concerning spiritual <span class='add'>gifts</span>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_2">2&#160;</span> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_3">3&#160;</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <span class='add'>that</span> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_4">4&#160;</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_5">5&#160;</span> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_6">6&#160;</span> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_7">7&#160;</span> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_8">8&#160;</span> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
<span class="verse" id="C112_9">9&#160;</span> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

<span class="verse" id="C112_12">12&#160;</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <span class='add'>is</span> Christ.

<span class="verse" id="C112_14">14&#160;</span> For the body is not one member, but many. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_15">15&#160;</span> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
<span class="verse" id="C112_16">16&#160;</span> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

<span class="verse" id="C112_18">18&#160;</span> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_19">19&#160;</span> And if they were all one member, where <span class='add'>were</span> the body? 
<span class="verse" id="C112_20">20&#160;</span> But now <span class='add'>are they</span> many members, yet but one body. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_21">21&#160;</span> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_22">22&#160;</span> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 
<span class="verse" id="C112_23">23&#160;</span> And those <span class='add'>members</span> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <span class='add'>parts</span> have more abundant comeliness. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_24">24&#160;</span> For our comely <span class='add'>parts</span> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <span class='add'>part</span> which lacked: 
<span class="verse" id="C112_25">25&#160;</span> That there should be no schism in the body; but <span class='add'>that</span> the members should have the same care one for another. 
<span class="verse" id="C112_26">26&#160;</span> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

<span class="verse" id="C112_28">28&#160;</span> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

<span class="verse" id="C114_7">7&#160;</span> And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?

<span class="verse" id="C114_9">9&#160;</span> So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_10">10&#160;</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them <span class='add'>is</span> without signification.

<span class="verse" id="C114_19">19&#160;</span> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that <span class='add'>by my voice</span> I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an <span class='add'>unknown</span> tongue. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_20">20&#160;</span> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_21">21&#160;</span> In the law it is written, With <span class='add'>men of</span> other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_22">22&#160;</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying <span class='add'>serveth</span> not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_23">23&#160;</span> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <span class='add'>those that are</span> unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 
<span class="verse" id="C114_24">24&#160;</span> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or <span class='add'>one</span> unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 
<span class="verse" id="C114_25">25&#160;</span> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on <span class='add'>his</span> face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_26">26&#160;</span> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_27">27&#160;</span> If any man speak in an <span class='add'>unknown</span> tongue, <span class='add'>let it be</span> by two, or at the most <span class='add'>by</span> three, and <span class='add'>that</span> by course; and let one interpret. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_28">28&#160;</span> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
<span class="verse" id="C114_29">29&#160;</span> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

<span class="verse" id="C115_1">1&#160;</span> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
<span class="verse" id="C115_2">2&#160;</span> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_3">3&#160;</span> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
<span class="verse" id="C115_4">4&#160;</span> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 
<span class="verse" id="C115_5">5&#160;</span> And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
<span class="verse" id="C115_6">6&#160;</span> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_7">7&#160;</span> After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_8">8&#160;</span> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_9">9&#160;</span> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_10">10&#160;</span> But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which <span class='add'>was bestowed</span> upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_11">11&#160;</span> Therefore whether <span class='add'>it were</span> I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

<span class="verse" id="C115_15">15&#160;</span> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

<span class="verse" id="C115_41">41&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for <span class='add'>one</span> star differeth from <span class='add'>another</span> star in glory. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_42">42&#160;</span> So also <span class='add'>is</span> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
<span class="verse" id="C115_43">43&#160;</span> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
<span class="verse" id="C115_44">44&#160;</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_45">45&#160;</span> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <span class='add'>was made</span> a quickening spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_46">46&#160;</span> Howbeit that <span class='add'>was</span> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_47">47&#160;</span> The first man <span class='add'>is</span> of the earth, earthy: the second man <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord from heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_48">48&#160;</span> As <span class='add'>is</span> the earthy, such <span class='add'>are</span> they also that are earthy: and as <span class='add'>is</span> the heavenly, such <span class='add'>are</span> they also that are heavenly. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_49">49&#160;</span> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_50">50&#160;</span> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_51">51&#160;</span> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
<span class="verse" id="C115_52">52&#160;</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_53">53&#160;</span> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <span class='add'>must</span> put on immortality. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_54">54&#160;</span> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_55">55&#160;</span> O death, where <span class='add'>is</span> thy sting? O grave, where <span class='add'>is</span> thy victory? 
<span class="verse" id="C115_56">56&#160;</span> The sting of death <span class='add'>is</span> sin; and the strength of sin <span class='add'>is</span> the law. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_57">57&#160;</span> But thanks <span class='add'>be</span> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C115_58">58&#160;</span> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="C116_1">1&#160;</span> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_2">2&#160;</span> Upon the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <span class='add'>God</span> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_3">3&#160;</span> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <span class='add'>your</span> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_4">4&#160;</span> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_5">5&#160;</span> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_6">6&#160;</span> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_7">7&#160;</span> For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_8">8&#160;</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_9">9&#160;</span> For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <span class='add'>there are</span> many adversaries. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_10">10&#160;</span> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <span class='add'>do</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_11">11&#160;</span> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_12">12&#160;</span> As touching <span class='add'>our</span> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_13">13&#160;</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_14">14&#160;</span> Let all your things be done with charity. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_15">15&#160;</span> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <span class='add'>that</span> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
<span class="verse" id="C116_16">16&#160;</span> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <span class='add'>us</span>, and laboureth. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_17">17&#160;</span> I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_18">18&#160;</span> For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. </div>

<span class="verse" id="C116_19">19&#160;</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_20">20&#160;</span> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. 
<span class="verse" id="C116_21">21&#160;</span> The salutation of <span class='add'>me</span> Paul with mine own hand.
