<div class='psalmlabel' id='S11_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="S11_1">1&#160;</span> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
<span class="verse" id="S11_2">2&#160;</span> And he had two wives; the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<span class="verse" id="S11_3">3&#160;</span> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>were</span> there.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S11_4">4&#160;</span>¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
<span class="verse" id="S11_5">5&#160;</span> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had shut up her womb.
<span class="verse" id="S11_6">6&#160;</span> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had shut up her womb.
<span class="verse" id="S11_7">7&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as</span> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
<span class="verse" id="S11_8">8&#160;</span> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? <span class='add'>am</span> not I better to thee than ten sons? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S11_9">9&#160;</span>¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S11_10">10&#160;</span>And she <span class='add'>was</span> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and wept sore.
<span class="verse" id="S11_11">11&#160;</span> And she vowed a vow, and said, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
<span class="verse" id="S11_12">12&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that Eli marked her mouth.
<span class="verse" id="S11_13">13&#160;</span> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
<span class="verse" id="S11_14">14&#160;</span> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
<span class="verse" id="S11_15">15&#160;</span> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I <span class='add'>am</span> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S11_16">16&#160;</span> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
<span class="verse" id="S11_17">17&#160;</span> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant <span class='add'>thee</span> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
<span class="verse" id="S11_18">18&#160;</span> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more <span class='add'>sad</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S11_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> remembered her.
<span class="verse" id="S11_20">20&#160;</span> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Because I have asked him of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S11_21">21&#160;</span> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
<span class="verse" id="S11_22">22&#160;</span> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <span class='add'>I will not go up</span> until the child be weaned, and <span class='add'>then</span> I will bring him, that he may appear before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and there abide for ever.
<span class="verse" id="S11_23">23&#160;</span> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S11_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in Shiloh: and the child <span class='add'>was</span> young.
<span class="verse" id="S11_25">25&#160;</span> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
<span class="verse" id="S11_26">26&#160;</span> And she said, Oh my lord, <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, my lord, I <span class='add'>am</span> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S11_27">27&#160;</span> For this child I prayed; and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
<span class="verse" id="S11_28">28&#160;</span> Therefore also I have lent him to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. And he worshipped the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> there.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S12_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_1">1&#160;</span> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, mine horn is exalted in the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
<span class="verse" id="S12_2">2&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> none holy as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for <span class='add'>there is</span> none beside thee: neither <span class='add'>is there</span> any rock like our God.
<span class="verse" id="S12_3">3&#160;</span> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let <span class='add'>not</span> arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>is</span> a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
<span class="verse" id="S12_4">4&#160;</span> The bows of the mighty men <span class='add'>are</span> broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<span class="verse" id="S12_5">5&#160;</span> <span class='add'>They that were</span> full have hired out themselves for bread; and <span class='add'>they that were</span> hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
<span class="verse" id="S12_6">6&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
<span class="verse" id="S12_7">7&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
<span class="verse" id="S12_8">8&#160;</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <span class='add'>and</span> lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set <span class='add'>them</span> among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth <span class='add'>are</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span>, and he hath set the world upon them.
<span class="verse" id="S12_9">9&#160;</span> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
<span class="verse" id="S12_10">10&#160;</span> The adversaries of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_11">11&#160;</span> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> before Eli the priest. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_12">12&#160;</span>¶ Now the sons of Eli <span class='add'>were</span> sons of Belial; they knew not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S12_13">13&#160;</span> And the priests’ custom with the people <span class='add'>was, that</span>, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
<span class="verse" id="S12_14">14&#160;</span> And he struck <span class='add'>it</span> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
<span class="verse" id="S12_15">15&#160;</span> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
<span class="verse" id="S12_16">16&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and <span class='add'>then</span> take <span class='add'>as much</span> as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, <span class='add'>Nay;</span> but thou shalt give <span class='add'>it me</span> now: and if not, I will take <span class='add'>it</span> by force.
<span class="verse" id="S12_17">17&#160;</span> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for men abhorred the offering of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_18">18&#160;</span>¶ But Samuel ministered before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>being</span> a child, girded with a linen ephod.
<span class="verse" id="S12_19">19&#160;</span> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_20">20&#160;</span>¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. And they went unto their own home.
<span class="verse" id="S12_21">21&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_22">22&#160;</span>¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled <span class='add'>at</span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<span class="verse" id="S12_23">23&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
<span class="verse" id="S12_24">24&#160;</span> Nay, my sons; for <span class='add'>it is</span> no good report that I hear: ye make the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> people to transgress.
<span class="verse" id="S12_25">25&#160;</span> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> would slay them.
<span class="verse" id="S12_26">26&#160;</span> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and also with men. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S12_27">27&#160;</span>¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?
<span class="verse" id="S12_28">28&#160;</span> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel <span class='add'>to be</span> my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
<span class="verse" id="S12_29">29&#160;</span> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded <span class='add'>in my</span> habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
<span class="verse" id="S12_30">30&#160;</span> Wherefore the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel saith, I said indeed <span class='add'>that</span> thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
<span class="verse" id="S12_31">31&#160;</span> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
<span class="verse" id="S12_32">32&#160;</span> And thou shalt see an enemy <span class='add'>in my</span> habitation, in all <span class='add'>the wealth</span> which <span class='add'>God</span> shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
<span class="verse" id="S12_33">33&#160;</span> And the man of thine, <span class='add'>whom</span> I shall not cut off from mine altar, <span class='add'>shall be</span> to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
<span class="verse" id="S12_34">34&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
<span class="verse" id="S12_35">35&#160;</span> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, <span class='add'>that</span> shall do according to <span class='add'>that</span> which <span class='add'>is</span> in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
<span class="verse" id="S12_36">36&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> every one that is left in thine house shall come <span class='add'>and</span> crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S13_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S13_1">1&#160;</span> And the child Samuel ministered unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> before Eli. And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was precious in those days; <span class='add'>there was</span> no open vision.
<span class="verse" id="S13_2">2&#160;</span> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <span class='add'>was</span> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <span class='add'>that</span> he could not see;
<span class="verse" id="S13_3">3&#160;</span> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, where the ark of God <span class='add'>was</span>, and Samuel was laid down <span class='add'>to sleep;</span>
<span class="verse" id="S13_4">4&#160;</span> That the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called Samuel: and he answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.
<span class="verse" id="S13_5">5&#160;</span> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
<span class="verse" id="S13_6">6&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
<span class="verse" id="S13_7">7&#160;</span> Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, neither was the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> yet revealed unto him.<span class='nd'></span><span class='nd'></span>
<span class="verse" id="S13_8">8&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had called the child.
<span class="verse" id="S13_9">9&#160;</span> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<span class="verse" id="S13_10">10&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S13_11">11&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
<span class="verse" id="S13_12">12&#160;</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all <span class='add'>things</span> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
<span class="verse" id="S13_13">13&#160;</span> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
<span class="verse" id="S13_14">14&#160;</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S13_15">15&#160;</span>¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
<span class="verse" id="S13_16">16&#160;</span> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.
<span class="verse" id="S13_17">17&#160;</span> And he said, What <span class='add'>is</span> the thing that <span class='add'>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></span> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <span class='add'>it</span> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <span class='add'>any</span> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
<span class="verse" id="S13_18">18&#160;</span> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <span class='add'>is</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: let him do what seemeth him good.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S13_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And Samuel grew, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
<span class="verse" id="S13_20">20&#160;</span> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel <span class='add'>was</span> established  <span class='add'>to be</span> a prophet of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S13_21">21&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> appeared again in Shiloh: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S14_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S14_1">1&#160;</span> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
<span class="verse" id="S14_2">2&#160;</span> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S14_3">3&#160;</span>¶ And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

<span class="verse" id="S19_13">13&#160;</span> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <span class='add'>and</span> afterwards they eat that be bidden.

<span class="verse" id="S19_14">14&#160;</span> And they went up into the city: <span class='add'>and</span> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S19_20">20&#160;</span> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <span class='add'>is</span> all the desire of Israel? <span class='add'>Is it</span> not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?
<span class="verse" id="S19_21">21&#160;</span> And Saul answered and said, <span class='add'>Am</span> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
<span class="verse" id="S19_22">22&#160;</span> And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <span class='add'>were</span> about thirty persons.

<span class="verse" id="S113_18">18&#160;</span> And another company turned the way <span class='add'>to</span> Beth-horon: and another company turned <span class='add'>to</span> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S113_19">19&#160;</span>¶ Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <span class='add'>them</span> swords or spears:
<span class="verse" id="S113_20">20&#160;</span> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
<span class="verse" id="S113_21">21&#160;</span> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
<span class="verse" id="S113_22">22&#160;</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
<span class="verse" id="S113_23">23&#160;</span> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S114_0'> 14</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_1">1&#160;</span> Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that <span class='add'>is</span> on the other side. But he told not his father.
<span class="verse" id="S114_2">2&#160;</span> And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which <span class='add'>is</span> in Migron: and the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him <span class='add'>were</span> about six hundred men;
<span class="verse" id="S114_3">3&#160;</span> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_4">4&#160;</span>¶ And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, <span class='add'>there was</span> a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<span class="verse" id="S114_5">5&#160;</span> The forefront of the one <span class='add'>was</span> situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
<span class="verse" id="S114_6">6&#160;</span> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will work for us: for <span class='add'>there is</span> no restraint to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to save by many or by few.
<span class="verse" id="S114_7">7&#160;</span> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that <span class='add'>is</span> in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> with thee according to thy heart.
<span class="verse" id="S114_8">8&#160;</span> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto <span class='add'>these</span> men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
<span class="verse" id="S114_9">9&#160;</span> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
<span class="verse" id="S114_10">10&#160;</span> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath delivered them into our hand: and this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign unto us.
<span class="verse" id="S114_11">11&#160;</span> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
<span class="verse" id="S114_12">12&#160;</span> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
<span class="verse" id="S114_13">13&#160;</span> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
<span class="verse" id="S114_14">14&#160;</span> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, <span class='add'>which</span> a yoke <span class='add'>of oxen might plow</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S114_15">15&#160;</span> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_16">16&#160;</span> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down <span class='add'>one another</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S114_17">17&#160;</span> Then said Saul unto the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer <span class='add'>were</span> not <span class='add'>there</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S114_18">18&#160;</span> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that <span class='add'>was</span> in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
<span class="verse" id="S114_20">20&#160;</span> And Saul and all the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, <span class='add'>and there was</span> a very great discomfiture.
<span class="verse" id="S114_21">21&#160;</span> Moreover the Hebrews <span class='add'>that</span> were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp <span class='add'>from the country</span> round about, even they also <span class='add'>turned</span> to be with the Israelites that <span class='add'>were</span> with Saul and Jonathan.
<span class="verse" id="S114_22">22&#160;</span> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, <span class='add'>when</span> they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
<span class="verse" id="S114_23">23&#160;</span> So the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>be</span> the man that eateth <span class='add'>any</span> food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted <span class='add'>any</span> food.
<span class="verse" id="S114_25">25&#160;</span>And all <span class='add'>they of</span> the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
<span class="verse" id="S114_26">26&#160;</span> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
<span class="verse" id="S114_27">27&#160;</span> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
<span class="verse" id="S114_28">28&#160;</span> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>be</span> the man that eateth <span class='add'>any</span> food this day. And the people were faint.
<span class="verse" id="S114_29">29&#160;</span> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
<span class="verse" id="S114_30">30&#160;</span> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
<span class="verse" id="S114_31">31&#160;</span> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
<span class="verse" id="S114_32">32&#160;</span> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew <span class='add'>them</span> on the ground: and the people did eat <span class='add'>them</span> with the blood. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_33">33&#160;</span>¶ Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
<span class="verse" id="S114_34">34&#160;</span> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay <span class='add'>them</span> here, and eat; and sin not against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew <span class='add'>them</span> there.
<span class="verse" id="S114_35">35&#160;</span> And Saul built an altar unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: the same was the first altar that he built unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.<span class='nd'></span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
<span class="verse" id="S114_37">37&#160;</span> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
<span class="verse" id="S114_38">38&#160;</span> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
<span class="verse" id="S114_39">39&#160;</span>For, <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.

<span class="verse" id="S114_40">40&#160;</span> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
<span class="verse" id="S114_41">41&#160;</span> Therefore Saul said unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, Give a perfect <span class='add'>lot</span>. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
<span class="verse" id="S114_42">42&#160;</span> And Saul said, Cast <span class='add'>lots</span> between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<span class="verse" id="S114_43">43&#160;</span> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that <span class='add'>was</span> in mine hand, <span class='add'>and</span>, lo, I must die.
<span class="verse" id="S114_44">44&#160;</span> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
<span class="verse" id="S114_45">45&#160;</span> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
<span class="verse" id="S114_46">46&#160;</span> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S114_47">47&#160;</span>¶ So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed <span class='add'>them</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S114_48">48&#160;</span> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
<span class="verse" id="S114_49">49&#160;</span> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters <span class='add'>were these;</span> the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
<span class="verse" id="S114_50">50&#160;</span> And the name of Saul’s wife <span class='add'>was</span> Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host <span class='add'>was</span> Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
<span class="verse" id="S114_51">51&#160;</span> And Kish <span class='add'>was</span> the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner <span class='add'>was</span> the son of Abiel.
<span class="verse" id="S114_52">52&#160;</span> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S115_1">1&#160;</span> Samuel also said unto Saul, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent me to anoint thee <span class='add'>to be</span> king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S115_2">2&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, I remember <span class='add'>that</span> which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid <span class='add'>wait</span> for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
<span class="verse" id="S115_3">3&#160;</span> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
<span class="verse" id="S115_4">4&#160;</span> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<span class="verse" id="S115_5">5&#160;</span> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S115_6">6&#160;</span>¶ And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<span class="verse" id="S115_7">7&#160;</span> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah <span class='add'>until</span> thou comest to Shur, that <span class='add'>is</span> over against Egypt.
<span class="verse" id="S115_8">8&#160;</span> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
<span class="verse" id="S115_9">9&#160;</span> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all <span class='add'>that was</span> good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing <span class='add'>that was</span> vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S115_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Then came the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Samuel, saying,
<span class="verse" id="S115_11">11&#160;</span> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul <span class='add'>to be</span> king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> all night.
<span class="verse" id="S115_12">12&#160;</span> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
<span class="verse" id="S115_13">13&#160;</span> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> thou of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: I have performed the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S115_14">14&#160;</span> And Samuel said, What <span class='add'>meaneth</span> then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
<span class="verse" id="S115_15">15&#160;</span> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
<span class="verse" id="S115_16">16&#160;</span> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
<span class="verse" id="S115_17">17&#160;</span> And Samuel said, When thou <span class='add'>wast</span> little in thine own sight, <span class='add'>wast</span> thou not <span class='add'>made</span> the head of the tribes of Israel, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> anointed thee king over Israel?
<span class="verse" id="S115_18">18&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
<span class="verse" id="S115_19">19&#160;</span> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>?
<span class="verse" id="S115_20">20&#160;</span> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and have gone the way which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
<span class="verse" id="S115_21">21&#160;</span> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God in Gilgal.
<span class="verse" id="S115_22">22&#160;</span> And Samuel said, Hath the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>as great</span> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>?

<span class="verse" id="S115_23">23&#160;</span> For rebellion <span class='add'>is as</span> the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness <span class='add'>is as</span> iniquity and idolatry.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S115_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
<span class="verse" id="S115_25">25&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S115_26">26&#160;</span> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
<span class="verse" id="S115_27">27&#160;</span> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
<span class="verse" id="S115_28">28&#160;</span> And Samuel said unto him, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, <span class='add'>that is</span> better than thou.
<span class="verse" id="S115_29">29&#160;</span> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <span class='add'>is</span> not a man, that he should repent.
<span class="verse" id="S115_30">30&#160;</span> Then he said, I have sinned: <span class='add'>yet</span> honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God.
<span class="verse" id="S115_31">31&#160;</span> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S115_34">34&#160;</span>¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S116_1">1&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<span class="verse" id="S116_2">2&#160;</span> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <span class='add'>it</span>, he will kill me. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S116_3">3&#160;</span> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <span class='add'>him</span> whom I name unto thee.
<span class="verse" id="S116_4">4&#160;</span> And Samuel did that which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?

<span class="verse" id="S116_8">8&#160;</span> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> chosen this.

<span class="verse" id="S117_41">41&#160;</span> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield <span class='add'>went</span> before him.

<span class="verse" id="S117_46">46&#160;</span> This day will the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

<span class="verse" id="S119_11">11&#160;</span> Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S120_1">1&#160;</span> And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what <span class='add'>is</span> mine iniquity? and what <span class='add'>is</span> my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
<span class="verse" id="S120_2">2&#160;</span> And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it <span class='add'>is</span> not <span class='add'>so</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S120_3">3&#160;</span> And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, <span class='add'>there is</span> but a step between me and death.
<span class="verse" id="S120_4">4&#160;</span> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do <span class='add'>it</span> for thee.
<span class="verse" id="S120_5">5&#160;</span> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow <span class='add'>is</span> the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third <span class='add'>day</span> at even.
<span class="verse" id="S120_6">6&#160;</span> If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked <span class='add'>leave</span> of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for <span class='add'>there is</span> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
<span class="verse" id="S120_7">7&#160;</span> If he say thus, <span class='add'>It is</span> well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, <span class='add'>then</span> be sure that evil is determined by him.
<span class="verse" id="S120_8">8&#160;</span> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S120_9">9&#160;</span> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
<span class="verse" id="S120_10">10&#160;</span> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what <span class='add'>if</span> thy father answer thee roughly? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S120_11">11&#160;</span>¶ And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<span class="verse" id="S120_12">12&#160;</span> And Jonathan said unto David, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <span class='add'>or</span> the third <span class='add'>day</span>, and, behold, <span class='add'>if there be</span> good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
<span class="verse" id="S120_13">13&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father <span class='add'>to do</span> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
<span class="verse" id="S120_14">14&#160;</span> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that I die not:

<span class="verse" id="S120_16">16&#160;</span> So Jonathan made <span class='add'>a covenant</span> with the house of David, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Let the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> even require <span class='add'>it</span> at the hand of David’s enemies.
<span class="verse" id="S120_17">17&#160;</span> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
<span class="verse" id="S120_18">18&#160;</span> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow <span class='add'>is</span> the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
<span class="verse" id="S120_19">19&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>when</span> thou hast stayed three days, <span class='add'>then</span> thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was <span class='add'>in hand</span>, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
<span class="verse" id="S120_20">20&#160;</span> And I will shoot three arrows on the side <span class='add'>thereof</span>, as though I shot at a mark.
<span class="verse" id="S120_21">21&#160;</span> And, behold, I will send a lad, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Go, find out the arrows.

<span class="verse" id="S120_22">22&#160;</span> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows <span class='add'>are</span> beyond thee; go thy way: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath sent thee away.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S120_24">24&#160;</span>¶ So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
<span class="verse" id="S120_25">25&#160;</span> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, <span class='add'>even</span> upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.
<span class="verse" id="S120_26">26&#160;</span> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he <span class='add'>is</span> not clean; surely he <span class='add'>is</span> not clean.
<span class="verse" id="S120_27">27&#160;</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, <span class='add'>which was</span> the second <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
<span class="verse" id="S120_28">28&#160;</span> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked <span class='add'>leave</span> of me <span class='add'>to go</span> to Beth-lehem:
<span class="verse" id="S120_29">29&#160;</span> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <span class='add'>to be there:</span> and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.
<span class="verse" id="S120_30">30&#160;</span> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious <span class='add'>woman</span>, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?
<span class="verse" id="S120_31">31&#160;</span> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
<span class="verse" id="S120_32">32&#160;</span> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
<span class="verse" id="S120_33">33&#160;</span> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
<span class="verse" id="S120_34">34&#160;</span> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S120_35">35&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
<span class="verse" id="S120_36">36&#160;</span> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. <span class='add'>And</span> as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
<span class="verse" id="S120_37">37&#160;</span> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, <span class='add'>Is</span> not the arrow beyond thee?
<span class="verse" id="S120_38">38&#160;</span> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
<span class="verse" id="S120_39">39&#160;</span> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
<span class="verse" id="S120_40">40&#160;</span> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry <span class='add'>them</span> to the city.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S120_41">41&#160;</span>¶ <span class='add'>And</span> as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <span class='add'>a place</span> toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
<span class="verse" id="S120_42">42&#160;</span> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.<span class='nd'></span>  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S121_0'> 21</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S121_1">1&#160;</span> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why <span class='add'>art</span> thou alone, and no man with thee?
<span class="verse" id="S121_2">2&#160;</span> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed <span class='add'>my</span> servants to such and such a place.
<span class="verse" id="S121_3">3&#160;</span> Now therefore what is under thine hand? give <span class='add'>me</span> five <span class='add'>loaves of</span> bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
<span class="verse" id="S121_4">4&#160;</span> And the priest answered David, and said, <span class='add'>There is</span> no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
<span class="verse" id="S121_5">5&#160;</span> And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women <span class='add'>have been</span> kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and <span class='add'>the bread is</span> in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
<span class="verse" id="S121_6">6&#160;</span> So the priest gave him hallowed <span class='add'>bread:</span> for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
<span class="verse" id="S121_7">7&#160;</span> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul <span class='add'>was</span> there that day, detained before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that <span class='add'>belonged</span> to Saul. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S121_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.
<span class="verse" id="S121_9">9&#160;</span> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it <span class='add'>is here</span> wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take <span class='add'>it:</span> for <span class='add'>there is</span> no other save that here.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S121_10">10&#160;</span>¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<span class="verse" id="S121_11">11&#160;</span> And the servants of Achish said unto him, <span class='add'>Is</span> not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<span class="verse" id="S121_12">12&#160;</span> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<span class="verse" id="S121_13">13&#160;</span> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
<span class="verse" id="S121_14">14&#160;</span> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore <span class='add'>then</span> have ye brought him to me?
<span class="verse" id="S121_15">15&#160;</span> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this <span class='add'>fellow</span> to play the mad man in my presence? shall this <span class='add'>fellow</span> come into my house?  </div>

<span class="verse" id="S122_1">1&#160;</span> David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they went down thither to him.
<span class="verse" id="S122_2">2&#160;</span> And every one <span class='add'>that was</span> in distress, and every one that <span class='add'>was</span> in debt, and every one <span class='add'>that was</span> discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S122_3">3&#160;</span>¶ And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, <span class='add'>and be</span> with you, till I know what God will do for me.
<span class="verse" id="S122_4">4&#160;</span> And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S122_5">5&#160;</span>¶ And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S122_6">6&#160;</span>¶ When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants <span class='add'>were</span> standing about him;)
<span class="verse" id="S122_7">7&#160;</span> Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, <span class='add'>and</span> make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;

<span class="verse" id="S122_9">9&#160;</span>¶ Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<span class="verse" id="S122_10">10&#160;</span> And he enquired of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<span class="verse" id="S122_11">11&#160;</span> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that <span class='add'>were</span> in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

<span class="verse" id="S122_14">14&#160;</span> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who <span class='add'>is so</span> faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
<span class="verse" id="S122_15">15&#160;</span> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute <span class='add'>any</span> thing unto his servant, <span class='add'>nor</span> to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
<span class="verse" id="S122_16">16&#160;</span> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S123_10">10&#160;</span> Then said David, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<span class="verse" id="S123_11">11&#160;</span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, He will come down.
<span class="verse" id="S123_12">12&#160;</span> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, They will deliver <span class='add'>thee</span> up.</div>

<span class="verse" id="S123_13">13&#160;</span>¶ Then David and his men, <span class='add'>which were</span> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S123_14">14&#160;</span> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
<span class="verse" id="S123_15">15&#160;</span> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <span class='add'>was</span> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S123_20">20&#160;</span> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <span class='add'>shall be</span> to deliver him into the king’s hand.

<span class="verse" id="S123_22">22&#160;</span> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <span class='add'>and</span> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <span class='add'>that</span> he dealeth very subtilly.
<span class="verse" id="S123_23">23&#160;</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
<span class="verse" id="S123_24">24&#160;</span> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <span class='add'>were</span> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
<span class="verse" id="S123_25">25&#160;</span> Saul also and his men went to seek <span class='add'>him</span>.

<span class="verse" id="S123_26">26&#160;</span> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S123_27">27&#160;</span>¶ But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

<span class="verse" id="S124_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David <span class='add'>is</span> in the wilderness of En-gedi.
<span class="verse" id="S124_2">2&#160;</span> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
<span class="verse" id="S124_3">3&#160;</span> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where <span class='add'>was</span> a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
<span class="verse" id="S124_4">4&#160;</span> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
<span class="verse" id="S124_5">5&#160;</span> And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
<span class="verse" id="S124_6">6&#160;</span> And he said unto his men, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he <span class='add'>is</span> the anointed of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="S124_7">7&#160;</span> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on <span class='add'>his</span> way.
<span class="verse" id="S124_8">8&#160;</span> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S124_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

<span class="verse" id="S124_11">11&#160;</span> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that <span class='add'>there is</span> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
<span class="verse" id="S124_12">12&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> judge between me and thee, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

<span class="verse" id="S124_16">16&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, <span class='add'>Is</span> this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
<span class="verse" id="S124_17">17&#160;</span> And he said to David, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

<span class="verse" id="S124_21">21&#160;</span> Swear now therefore unto me by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_1">1&#160;</span> And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_2">2&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> a man in Maon, whose possessions <span class='add'>were</span> in Carmel; and the man <span class='add'>was</span> very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<span class="verse" id="S125_3">3&#160;</span> Now the name of the man <span class='add'>was</span> Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and <span class='add'>she was</span> a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man <span class='add'>was</span> churlish and evil in his doings; and he <span class='add'>was</span> of the house of Caleb. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_4">4&#160;</span>¶ And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
<span class="verse" id="S125_5">5&#160;</span> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
<span class="verse" id="S125_6">6&#160;</span> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth <span class='add'>in prosperity</span>, Peace <span class='add'>be</span> both to thee, and peace <span class='add'>be</span> to thine house, and peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto all that thou hast.
<span class="verse" id="S125_7">7&#160;</span> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
<span class="verse" id="S125_8">8&#160;</span> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
<span class="verse" id="S125_9">9&#160;</span> And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_10">10&#160;</span>¶ And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who <span class='add'>is</span> David? and who <span class='add'>is</span> the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
<span class="verse" id="S125_11">11&#160;</span> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give <span class='add'>it</span> unto men, whom I know not whence they <span class='add'>be</span>?</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_12">12&#160;</span> So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
<span class="verse" id="S125_13">13&#160;</span> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_14">14&#160;</span>¶ But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
<span class="verse" id="S125_15">15&#160;</span> But the men <span class='add'>were</span> very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
<span class="verse" id="S125_16">16&#160;</span> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<span class="verse" id="S125_17">17&#160;</span> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he <span class='add'>is such</span> a son of Belial, that <span class='add'>a man</span> cannot speak to him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched <span class='add'>corn</span>, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid <span class='add'>them</span> on asses.
<span class="verse" id="S125_19">19&#160;</span> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
<span class="verse" id="S125_20">20&#160;</span>And it was <span class='add'>so, as</span> she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
<span class="verse" id="S125_21">21&#160;</span> Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this <span class='add'>fellow</span> hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that <span class='add'>pertained</span> unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
<span class="verse" id="S125_22">22&#160;</span> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that <span class='add'>pertain</span> to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
<span class="verse" id="S125_23">23&#160;</span> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
<span class="verse" id="S125_24">24&#160;</span> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, <span class='add'>upon</span> me <span class='add'>let this</span> iniquity <span class='add'>be:</span> and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
<span class="verse" id="S125_25">25&#160;</span> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, <span class='add'>even</span> Nabal: for as his name <span class='add'>is</span>, so <span class='add'>is</span> he; Nabal <span class='add'>is</span> his name, and folly <span class='add'>is</span> with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<span class="verse" id="S125_26">26&#160;</span> Now therefore, my lord, <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, seeing the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath withholden thee from coming to <span class='add'>shed</span> blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
<span class="verse" id="S125_27">27&#160;</span> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
<span class="verse" id="S125_28">28&#160;</span> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and evil hath not been found in thee <span class='add'>all</span> thy days.
<span class="verse" id="S125_29">29&#160;</span> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, <span class='add'>as out</span> of the middle of a sling.
<span class="verse" id="S125_30">30&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass, when the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
<span class="verse" id="S125_31">31&#160;</span> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_32">32&#160;</span>¶ And David said to Abigail, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:
<span class="verse" id="S125_33">33&#160;</span> And blessed <span class='add'>be</span> thy advice, and blessed <span class='add'>be</span> thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to <span class='add'>shed</span> blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
<span class="verse" id="S125_34">34&#160;</span> For in very deed, <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
<span class="verse" id="S125_35">35&#160;</span> So David received of her hand <span class='add'>that</span> which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart <span class='add'>was</span> merry within him, for he <span class='add'>was</span> very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
<span class="verse" id="S125_37">37&#160;</span> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became <span class='add'>as</span> a stone.
<span class="verse" id="S125_38">38&#160;</span> And it came to pass about ten days <span class='add'>after</span>, that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> smote Nabal, that he died. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_39">39&#160;</span>¶ And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
<span class="verse" id="S125_40">40&#160;</span> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
<span class="verse" id="S125_41">41&#160;</span> And she arose, and bowed herself on <span class='add'>her</span> face to the earth, and said, Behold, <span class='add'>let</span> thine handmaid <span class='add'>be</span> a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
<span class="verse" id="S125_42">42&#160;</span> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<span class="verse" id="S125_43">43&#160;</span> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S125_44">44&#160;</span>¶ But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which <span class='add'>was</span> of Gallim.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='S126_0'> 26</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S126_1">1&#160;</span> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, <span class='add'>which is</span> before Jeshimon?
<span class="verse" id="S126_2">2&#160;</span> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<span class="verse" id="S126_3">3&#160;</span> And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which <span class='add'>is</span> before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
<span class="verse" id="S126_4">4&#160;</span> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S126_5">5&#160;</span>¶ And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S126_6">6&#160;</span> Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
<span class="verse" id="S126_7">7&#160;</span> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
<span class="verse" id="S126_8">8&#160;</span> Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not <span class='add'>smite</span> him the second time.
<span class="verse" id="S126_9">9&#160;</span> And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> anointed, and be guiltless?
<span class="verse" id="S126_10">10&#160;</span> David said furthermore, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
<span class="verse" id="S126_11">11&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that <span class='add'>is</span> at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
<span class="verse" id="S126_12">12&#160;</span> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw <span class='add'>it</span>, nor knew <span class='add'>it</span>, neither awaked: for they <span class='add'>were</span> all asleep; because a deep sleep from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was fallen upon them. </div>

<span class="verse" id="S126_17">17&#160;</span> And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, <span class='add'>Is</span> this thy voice, my son David? And David said, <span class='add'>It is</span> my voice, my lord, O king.

<span class="verse" id="S128_9">9&#160;</span> And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

<span class="verse" id="S128_16">16&#160;</span> Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

<span class="verse" id="S128_18">18&#160;</span> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> done this thing unto thee this day.

<span class="verse" id="S128_20">20&#160;</span> Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</div>

<span class="verse" id="S128_21">21&#160;</span>¶ And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
<span class="verse" id="S128_22">22&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

<span class="verse" id="S129_7">7&#160;</span> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="S129_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?

<span class="verse" id="S129_10">10&#160;</span> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
