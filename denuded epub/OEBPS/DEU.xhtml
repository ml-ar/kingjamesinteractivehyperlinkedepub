<div class='mt'>The Fifth Book of Moses, called Deuteronomy  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='DT1_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="DT1_1">1&#160;</span>These <span class='add'>be</span> the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red <span class='add'>sea</span>, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_2">2&#160;</span>(<span class='add'>There are</span> eleven days’ <span class='add'>journey</span> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.) 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_3">3&#160;</span> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had given him in commandment unto them; 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_4">4&#160;</span> After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_5">5&#160;</span> On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_6">6&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_7">7&#160;</span> Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all <span class='add'>the places</span> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_8">8&#160;</span> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_10">10&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye <span class='add'>are</span> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_11">11&#160;</span>(The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye <span class='add'>are</span>, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_12">12&#160;</span> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_13">13&#160;</span> Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_14">14&#160;</span> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken <span class='add'>is</span> good <span class='add'>for us</span> to do. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_15">15&#160;</span> So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_16">16&#160;</span> And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <span class='add'>the causes</span> between your brethren, and judge righteously between <span class='add'>every</span> man and his brother, and the stranger <span class='add'>that is</span> with him. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_17">17&#160;</span> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; <span class='add'>but</span> ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment <span class='add'>is</span> God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring <span class='add'>it</span> unto me, and I will hear it.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_18">18&#160;</span> And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_20">20&#160;</span> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God doth give unto us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_21">21&#160;</span> Behold, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God hath set the land before thee: go up <span class='add'>and</span> possess <span class='add'>it</span>, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_22">22&#160;</span>¶ And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_23">23&#160;</span> And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_24">24&#160;</span> And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_25">25&#160;</span> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, <span class='add'>It is</span> a good land which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God doth give us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_26">26&#160;</span> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God: 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_27">27&#160;</span> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_28">28&#160;</span> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people <span class='add'>is</span> greater and taller than we; the cities <span class='add'>are</span> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_29">29&#160;</span> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_30">30&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_31">31&#160;</span> And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_32">32&#160;</span> Yet in this thing ye did not believe the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_33">33&#160;</span> Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents <span class='add'>in</span>, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_34">34&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_35">35&#160;</span> Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_36">36&#160;</span> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_37">37&#160;</span> Also the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_38">38&#160;</span> <span class='add'>But</span> Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_39">39&#160;</span> Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_40">40&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>as for</span> you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_41">41&#160;</span> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, we will go up and fight, according to all that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_42">42&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I <span class='add'>am</span> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_43">43&#160;</span> So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and went presumptuously up into the hill.
<span class="verse" id="DT1_44">44&#160;</span> And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, <span class='add'>even</span> unto Hormah. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_45">45&#160;</span> And ye returned and wept before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; but the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_46">46&#160;</span> So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode <span class='add'>there</span>.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='DT2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_1">1&#160;</span> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_2">2&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_3">3&#160;</span> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_4">4&#160;</span> And command thou the people, saying, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_5">5&#160;</span> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <span class='add'>for</span> a possession.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_6">6&#160;</span> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_7">7&#160;</span> For the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God <span class='add'>hath been</span> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_8">8&#160;</span> And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_9">9&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land <span class='add'>for</span> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <span class='add'>for</span> a possession.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_10">10&#160;</span> The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_11">11&#160;</span> Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_12">12&#160;</span> The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> gave unto them.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_13">13&#160;</span> Now rise up, <span class='add'>said I</span>, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_14">14&#160;</span> And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, <span class='add'>was</span> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sware unto them.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_15">15&#160;</span> For indeed the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_16">16&#160;</span>¶ So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_17">17&#160;</span> That the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_18">18&#160;</span> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_19">19&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>when</span> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <span class='add'>any</span> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot <span class='add'>for</span> a possession. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_20">20&#160;</span>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
<span class="verse" id="DT2_21">21&#160;</span> A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_22">22&#160;</span> As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_23">23&#160;</span> And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <span class='add'>even</span> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_24">24&#160;</span>¶ Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <span class='add'>it</span>, and contend with him in battle.
<span class="verse" id="DT2_25">25&#160;</span> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <span class='add'>that are</span> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_26">26&#160;</span>¶ And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_27">27&#160;</span> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_28">28&#160;</span> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_29">29&#160;</span>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God giveth us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_30">30&#160;</span> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as <span class='add'>appeareth</span> this day. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_31">31&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_32">32&#160;</span> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_33">33&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_34">34&#160;</span> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
<span class="verse" id="DT2_35">35&#160;</span> Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_36">36&#160;</span> From Aroer, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and <span class='add'>from</span> the city that <span class='add'>is</span> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God delivered all unto us: 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_37">37&#160;</span> Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, <span class='add'>nor</span> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God forbad us.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='DT3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_1">1&#160;</span> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_2">2&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_3">3&#160;</span> So the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_4">4&#160;</span> And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_5">5&#160;</span> All these cities <span class='add'>were</span> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_6">6&#160;</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_7">7&#160;</span> But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_8">8&#160;</span> And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <span class='add'>was</span> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_9">9&#160;</span>(<span class='add'>Which</span> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_10">10&#160;</span> All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_11">11&#160;</span> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <span class='add'>was</span> a bedstead of iron; <span class='add'>is</span> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <span class='add'>was</span> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_12">12&#160;</span> And this land, <span class='add'>which</span> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_13">13&#160;</span> And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <span class='add'>being</span> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_14">14&#160;</span> Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_15">15&#160;</span> And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_16">16&#160;</span> And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <span class='add'>which is</span> the border of the children of Ammon;
