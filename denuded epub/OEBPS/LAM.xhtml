<span class="verse" id="LM1_1">1&#160;</span> How doth the city sit solitary, <span class='add'>that was</span> full of people! <span class='add'>how</span> is she become as a widow! she <span class='add'>that was</span> great among the nations, <span class='add'>and</span> princess among the provinces, <span class='add'>how</span> is she become tributary!
<span class="verse" id="LM1_2">2&#160;</span> She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears <span class='add'>are</span> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort <span class='add'>her:</span> all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_3">3&#160;</span> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_4">4&#160;</span> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she <span class='add'>is</span> in bitterness.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_5">5&#160;</span> Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_6">6&#160;</span> And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts <span class='add'>that</span> find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_7">7&#160;</span> Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, <span class='add'>and</span> did mock at her sabbaths.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_8">8&#160;</span> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_9">9&#160;</span> Her filthiness <span class='add'>is</span> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified <span class='add'>himself</span>.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_10">10&#160;</span> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen <span class='add'>that</span> the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command <span class='add'>that</span> they should not enter into thy congregation.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_11">11&#160;</span> All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and consider; for I am become vile.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LM1_12">12&#160;</span>¶ <span class='add'>Is it</span> nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath afflicted <span class='add'>me</span> in the day of his fierce anger.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_13">13&#160;</span> From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate <span class='add'>and</span> faint all the day.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_14">14&#160;</span> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, <span class='add'>and</span> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into <span class='add'>their</span> hands, <span class='add'>from whom</span> I am not able to rise up.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_15">15&#160;</span> The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty <span class='add'>men</span> in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, <span class='add'>as</span> in a winepress.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_16">16&#160;</span>For these <span class='add'>things</span> I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_17">17&#160;</span> Zion spreadeth forth her hands, <span class='add'>and there is</span> none to comfort her: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath commanded concerning Jacob, <span class='add'>that</span> his adversaries <span class='add'>should be</span> round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LM1_18">18&#160;</span>¶ The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_19">19&#160;</span> I called for my lovers, <span class='add'>but</span> they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_20">20&#160;</span> Behold, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; for I <span class='add'>am</span> in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home <span class='add'>there is</span> as death.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_21">21&#160;</span> They have heard that I sigh: <span class='add'>there is</span> none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done <span class='add'>it:</span> thou wilt bring the day <span class='add'>that</span> thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
<span class="verse" id="LM1_22">22&#160;</span> Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs <span class='add'>are</span> many, and my heart <span class='add'>is</span> faint.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='LM2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LM2_1">1&#160;</span> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <span class='add'>and</span> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
<span class="verse" id="LM2_2">2&#160;</span> The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <span class='add'>them</span> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_3">3&#160;</span> He hath cut off in <span class='add'>his</span> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <span class='add'>which</span> devoureth round about.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_4">4&#160;</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <span class='add'>that were</span> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_5">5&#160;</span> The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_6">6&#160;</span> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <span class='add'>if it were of</span> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_7">7&#160;</span> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as in the day of a solemn feast.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_8">8&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_9">9&#160;</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <span class='add'>are</span> among the Gentiles: the law <span class='add'>is</span> no <span class='add'>more;</span> her prophets also find no vision from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LM2_10">10&#160;</span> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <span class='add'>and</span> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_11">11&#160;</span> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_12">12&#160;</span> They say to their mothers, Where <span class='add'>is</span> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_13">13&#160;</span> What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach <span class='add'>is</span> great like the sea: who can heal thee?
<span class="verse" id="LM2_14">14&#160;</span> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_15">15&#160;</span> All that pass by clap <span class='add'>their</span> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <span class='add'>saying, Is</span> this the city that <span class='add'>men</span> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
<span class="verse" id="LM2_16">16&#160;</span> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <span class='add'>her</span> up: certainly this <span class='add'>is</span> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <span class='add'>it</span>.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_17">17&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath done <span class='add'>that</span> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <span class='add'>thine</span> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_18">18&#160;</span> Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_19">19&#160;</span> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LM2_20">20&#160;</span>¶ Behold, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <span class='add'>and</span> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
<span class="verse" id="LM2_21">21&#160;</span> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <span class='add'>them</span> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <span class='add'>and</span> not pitied.
<span class="verse" id="LM2_22">22&#160;</span> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="LM3_1">1&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>am</span> the man <span class='add'>that</span> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_2">2&#160;</span> He hath led me, and brought <span class='add'>me into</span> darkness, but not <span class='add'>into</span> light.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_3">3&#160;</span> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand <span class='add'>against me</span> all the day.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_4">4&#160;</span> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_5">5&#160;</span> He hath builded against me, and compassed <span class='add'>me</span> with gall and travail.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_6">6&#160;</span> He hath set me in dark places, as <span class='add'>they that be</span> dead of old.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_7">7&#160;</span> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.

<span class="verse" id="LM3_9">9&#160;</span> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_10">10&#160;</span>He <span class='add'>was</span> unto me <span class='add'>as</span> a bear lying in wait, <span class='add'>and as</span> a lion in secret places.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_11">11&#160;</span> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_12">12&#160;</span> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_13">13&#160;</span> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_14">14&#160;</span> I was a derision to all my people; <span class='add'>and</span> their song all the day.
<span class="verse" id="LM3_15">15&#160;</span> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.

<span class="verse" id="LM3_18">18&#160;</span> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>:

<span class="verse" id="LM4_14">14&#160;</span> They have wandered <span class='add'>as</span> blind <span class='add'>men</span> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_15">15&#160;</span> They cried unto them, Depart ye; <span class='add'>it is</span> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <span class='add'>there</span>.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_16">16&#160;</span> The anger of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_17">17&#160;</span> As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <span class='add'>that</span> could not save <span class='add'>us</span>.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_18">18&#160;</span> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_19">19&#160;</span> Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
<span class="verse" id="LM4_20">20&#160;</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LM4_21">21&#160;</span>¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LM4_22">22&#160;</span>¶ The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</div>

<span class="verse" id="LM5_1">1&#160;</span> Remember, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.

<span class="verse" id="LM5_3">3&#160;</span> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <span class='add'>are</span> as widows.

<span class="verse" id="LM5_9">9&#160;</span> We gat our bread with <span class='add'>the peril of</span> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
<span class="verse" id="LM5_10">10&#160;</span> Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
<span class="verse" id="LM5_11">11&#160;</span> They ravished the women in Zion, <span class='add'>and</span> the maids in the cities of Judah.
<span class="verse" id="LM5_12">12&#160;</span> Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
<span class="verse" id="LM5_13">13&#160;</span> They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
<span class="verse" id="LM5_14">14&#160;</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.
