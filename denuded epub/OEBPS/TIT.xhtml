<div class='mt'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TITUS  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='TT1_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="TT1_1">1&#160;</span> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_2">2&#160;</span> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_3">3&#160;</span> But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_4">4&#160;</span> To Titus, <span class='add'>mine</span> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <span class='add'>and</span> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="TT1_5">5&#160;</span> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_6">6&#160;</span> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_7">7&#160;</span> For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_8">8&#160;</span> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_9">9&#160;</span> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_10">10&#160;</span> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_11">11&#160;</span> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_12">12&#160;</span> One of themselves, <span class='add'>even</span> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <span class='add'>are</span> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_13">13&#160;</span> This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_14">14&#160;</span> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_15">15&#160;</span> Unto the pure all things <span class='add'>are</span> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <span class='add'>is</span> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 
<span class="verse" id="TT1_16">16&#160;</span> They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <span class='add'>him</span>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='TT2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="TT2_1">1&#160;</span> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_2">2&#160;</span> That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_3">3&#160;</span> The aged women likewise, that <span class='add'>they be</span> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_4">4&#160;</span> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_5">5&#160;</span> <span class='add'>To be</span> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_6">6&#160;</span> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_7">7&#160;</span> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <span class='add'>shewing</span> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_8">8&#160;</span> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_9">9&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Exhort</span> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <span class='add'>and</span> to please <span class='add'>them</span> well in all <span class='add'>things</span>; not answering again; 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_10">10&#160;</span> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_11">11&#160;</span> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_12">12&#160;</span> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_13">13&#160;</span> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_14">14&#160;</span> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
<span class="verse" id="TT2_15">15&#160;</span> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='TT3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="TT3_1">1&#160;</span> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_2">2&#160;</span> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <span class='add'>but</span> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_3">3&#160;</span> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <span class='add'>and</span> hating one another. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_4">4&#160;</span> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_5">5&#160;</span> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_6">6&#160;</span> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_7">7&#160;</span> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_8">8&#160;</span> <span class='add'>This is</span> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_9">9&#160;</span> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_10">10&#160;</span> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_11">11&#160;</span> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="TT3_12">12&#160;</span> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_13">13&#160;</span> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_14">14&#160;</span> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 
<span class="verse" id="TT3_15">15&#160;</span> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <span class='add'>be</span> with you all. Amen. </div>
