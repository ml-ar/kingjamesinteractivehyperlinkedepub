<div class='mt'>The Book of Job  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB1_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="JB1_1">1&#160;</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_2">2&#160;</span> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_3">3&#160;</span> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB1_4">4&#160;</span> And his sons went and feasted <span class='add'>in their</span> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_5">5&#160;</span> And it was so, when the days of <span class='add'>their</span> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <span class='add'>according</span> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB1_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and Satan came also among them.
<span class="verse" id="JB1_7">7&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_8">8&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <span class='add'>there is</span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
<span class="verse" id="JB1_9">9&#160;</span> Then Satan answered the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_10">10&#160;</span> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
<span class="verse" id="JB1_11">11&#160;</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
<span class="verse" id="JB1_12">12&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <span class='add'>is</span> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB1_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <span class='add'>were</span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_14">14&#160;</span> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_15">15&#160;</span> And the Sabeans fell <span class='add'>upon them</span>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_16">16&#160;</span>While he <span class='add'>was</span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<span class="verse" id="JB1_17">17&#160;</span>While he <span class='add'>was</span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
<span class="verse" id="JB1_18">18&#160;</span>While he <span class='add'>was</span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters <span class='add'>were</span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_19">19&#160;</span> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB1_20">20&#160;</span> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
<span class="verse" id="JB1_21">21&#160;</span> And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> gave, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath taken away; blessed be the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="JB1_22">22&#160;</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB2_1">1&#160;</span> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_2">2&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_3">3&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <span class='add'>there is</span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
<span class="verse" id="JB2_4">4&#160;</span> And Satan answered the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_5">5&#160;</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_6">6&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, Behold, he <span class='add'>is</span> in thine hand; but save his life.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB2_7">7&#160;</span>¶ So went Satan forth from the presence of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_8">8&#160;</span> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB2_9">9&#160;</span>¶ Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_10">10&#160;</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB2_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_12">12&#160;</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="JB2_13">13&#160;</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that <span class='add'>his</span> grief was very great.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB3_1">1&#160;</span> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_2">2&#160;</span> And Job spake, and said,
<span class="verse" id="JB3_3">3&#160;</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <span class='add'>in which</span> it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_4">4&#160;</span> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_5">5&#160;</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_6">6&#160;</span>As <span class='add'>for</span> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_7">7&#160;</span> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_8">8&#160;</span> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_9">9&#160;</span> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <span class='add'>have</span> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
<span class="verse" id="JB3_10">10&#160;</span> Because it shut not up the doors of my <span class='add'>mother’s</span> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB3_11">11&#160;</span> Why died I not from the womb? <span class='add'>why</span> did I <span class='add'>not</span> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_12">12&#160;</span> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_13">13&#160;</span> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_14">14&#160;</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_15">15&#160;</span> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_16">16&#160;</span> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <span class='add'>which</span> never saw light. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_17">17&#160;</span> There the wicked cease <span class='add'>from</span> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_18">18&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There</span> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_19">19&#160;</span> The small and great are there; and the servant <span class='add'>is</span> free from his master. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB3_20">20&#160;</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <span class='add'>in</span> soul; 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_21">21&#160;</span> Which long for death, but it <span class='add'>cometh</span> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
<span class="verse" id="JB3_22">22&#160;</span> Which rejoice exceedingly, <span class='add'>and</span> are glad, when they can find the grave? 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_23">23&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Why is light given</span> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 
<span class="verse" id="JB3_24">24&#160;</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_25">25&#160;</span> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
<span class="verse" id="JB3_26">26&#160;</span> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB4_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB4_1">1&#160;</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_2">2&#160;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
<span class="verse" id="JB4_3">3&#160;</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_4">4&#160;</span> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_5">5&#160;</span> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_6">6&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not <span class='add'>this</span> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB4_7">7&#160;</span> Remember, I pray thee, who <span class='add'>ever</span> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_8">8&#160;</span> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_9">9&#160;</span> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
<span class="verse" id="JB4_10">10&#160;</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_11">11&#160;</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB4_12">12&#160;</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
<span class="verse" id="JB4_13">13&#160;</span> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_14">14&#160;</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
<span class="verse" id="JB4_15">15&#160;</span> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_16">16&#160;</span> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <span class='add'>was</span> before mine eyes, <span class='add'>there was</span> silence, and I heard a voice, <span class='add'>saying</span>,
<span class="verse" id="JB4_17">17&#160;</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_18">18&#160;</span> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
<span class="verse" id="JB4_19">19&#160;</span> How much less <span class='add'>in</span> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <span class='add'>is</span> in the dust, <span class='add'>which</span> are crushed before the moth? 
<span class="verse" id="JB4_20">20&#160;</span> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <span class='add'>it</span>.
<span class="verse" id="JB4_21">21&#160;</span> Doth not their excellency <span class='add'>which is</span> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB5_0'> 5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB5_1">1&#160;</span> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
<span class="verse" id="JB5_2">2&#160;</span> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_3">3&#160;</span> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_4">4&#160;</span> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither <span class='add'>is there</span> any to deliver <span class='add'>them</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_5">5&#160;</span> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB5_6">6&#160;</span> Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
<span class="verse" id="JB5_7">7&#160;</span> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_8">8&#160;</span> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_9">9&#160;</span> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
<span class="verse" id="JB5_10">10&#160;</span> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
<span class="verse" id="JB5_11">11&#160;</span> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_12">12&#160;</span> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform <span class='add'>their</span> enterprise.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_13">13&#160;</span> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_14">14&#160;</span> They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_15">15&#160;</span> But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_16">16&#160;</span> So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB5_17">17&#160;</span> Behold, happy <span class='add'>is</span> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_18">18&#160;</span> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_19">19&#160;</span> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_20">20&#160;</span> In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_21">21&#160;</span> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_22">22&#160;</span> At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_23">23&#160;</span> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
<span class="verse" id="JB5_24">24&#160;</span> And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle <span class='add'>shall be</span> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_25">25&#160;</span> Thou shalt know also that thy seed <span class='add'>shall be</span> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_26">26&#160;</span> Thou shalt come to <span class='add'>thy</span> grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
<span class="verse" id="JB5_27">27&#160;</span> Lo this, we have searched it, so it <span class='add'>is;</span> hear it, and know thou <span class='add'>it</span> for thy good.</div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='JB6_0'> 6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB6_1">1&#160;</span> But Job answered and said, 
<span class="verse" id="JB6_2">2&#160;</span> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
<span class="verse" id="JB6_3">3&#160;</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
<span class="verse" id="JB6_4">4&#160;</span> For the arrows of the Almighty <span class='add'>are</span> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 
<span class="verse" id="JB6_5">5&#160;</span> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
<span class="verse" id="JB6_6">6&#160;</span> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <span class='add'>any</span> taste in the white of an egg? 
<span class="verse" id="JB6_7">7&#160;</span>The things <span class='add'>that</span> my soul refused to touch <span class='add'>are</span> as my sorrowful meat. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JB6_8">8&#160;</span> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <span class='add'>me</span> the thing that I long for!

<span class="verse" id="JB42_3">3&#160;</span>Who <span class='add'>is</span> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.

<span class="verse" id="JB42_8">8&#160;</span> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you <span class='add'>after your</span> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me <span class='add'>the thing which is</span> right, like my servant Job.
<span class="verse" id="JB42_9">9&#160;</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <span class='add'>and</span> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded them: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> also accepted Job.</div>

<span class="verse" id="JB42_10">10&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before.
<span class="verse" id="JB42_11">11&#160;</span> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. 
<span class="verse" id="JB42_12">12&#160;</span> So the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
<span class="verse" id="JB42_13">13&#160;</span> He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
<span class="verse" id="JB42_14">14&#160;</span> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
