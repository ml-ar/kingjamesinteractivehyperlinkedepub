<span class="verse" id="LK1_1">1&#160;</span> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_2">2&#160;</span> Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_3">3&#160;</span> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_4">4&#160;</span> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK1_5">5&#160;</span>¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <span class='add'>was</span> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <span class='add'>was</span> Elisabeth. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_6">6&#160;</span> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_7">7&#160;</span> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <span class='add'>now</span> well stricken in years. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_8">8&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_9">9&#160;</span> According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_10">10&#160;</span> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_11">11&#160;</span> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_12">12&#160;</span> And when Zacharias saw <span class='add'>him</span>, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_13">13&#160;</span> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_14">14&#160;</span> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_15">15&#160;</span> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_16">16&#160;</span> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_17">17&#160;</span> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_18">18&#160;</span> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_19">19&#160;</span> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_20">20&#160;</span> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_21">21&#160;</span> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_22">22&#160;</span> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_23">23&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_24">24&#160;</span> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_25">25&#160;</span> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on <span class='add'>me</span>, to take away my reproach among men. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_26">26&#160;</span> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_27">27&#160;</span> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name <span class='add'>was</span> Mary. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_28">28&#160;</span> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <span class='add'>thou that art</span> highly favoured, the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with thee: blessed <span class='add'>art</span> thou among women. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_29">29&#160;</span> And when she saw <span class='add'>him</span>, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_30">30&#160;</span> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_31">31&#160;</span> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_32">32&#160;</span> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_33">33&#160;</span> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_34">34&#160;</span> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_35">35&#160;</span> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_36">36&#160;</span> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_37">37&#160;</span> For with God nothing shall be impossible. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_38">38&#160;</span> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_39">39&#160;</span> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_40">40&#160;</span> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_41">41&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_42">42&#160;</span> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <span class='add'>art</span> thou among women, and blessed <span class='add'>is</span> the fruit of thy womb. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_43">43&#160;</span> And whence <span class='add'>is</span> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_44">44&#160;</span> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_45">45&#160;</span> And blessed <span class='add'>is</span> she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_46">46&#160;</span> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_47">47&#160;</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_48">48&#160;</span> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_49">49&#160;</span> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy <span class='add'>is</span> his name. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_50">50&#160;</span> And his mercy <span class='add'>is</span> on them that fear him from generation to generation. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_51">51&#160;</span> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_52">52&#160;</span> He hath put down the mighty from <span class='add'>their</span> seats, and exalted them of low degree. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_53">53&#160;</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_54">54&#160;</span> He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of <span class='add'>his</span> mercy; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_55">55&#160;</span> As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_56">56&#160;</span> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_57">57&#160;</span> Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_58">58&#160;</span> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_59">59&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_60">60&#160;</span> And his mother answered and said, Not <span class='add'>so</span>; but he shall be called John. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_61">61&#160;</span> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_62">62&#160;</span> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_63">63&#160;</span> And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_64">64&#160;</span> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue <span class='add'>loosed</span>, and he spake, and praised God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_65">65&#160;</span> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_66">66&#160;</span> And all they that heard <span class='add'>them</span> laid <span class='add'>them</span> up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_67">67&#160;</span> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_68">68&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_69">69&#160;</span> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_70">70&#160;</span> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_71">71&#160;</span> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_72">72&#160;</span> To perform the mercy <span class='add'>promised</span> to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_73">73&#160;</span> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_74">74&#160;</span> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_75">75&#160;</span> In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_76">76&#160;</span> And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_77">77&#160;</span> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_78">78&#160;</span> Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_79">79&#160;</span> To give light to them that sit in darkness and <span class='add'>in</span> the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. 
<span class="verse" id="LK1_80">80&#160;</span> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='LK2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK2_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_2">2&#160;</span>(<span class='add'>And</span> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_3">3&#160;</span> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_4">4&#160;</span> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_5">5&#160;</span> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_6">6&#160;</span> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_7">7&#160;</span> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_8">8&#160;</span> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_9">9&#160;</span> And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_10">10&#160;</span> And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_11">11&#160;</span> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_12">12&#160;</span> And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_13">13&#160;</span> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_14">14&#160;</span> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_15">15&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_16">16&#160;</span> And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_17">17&#160;</span> And when they had seen <span class='add'>it</span>, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_18">18&#160;</span> And all they that heard <span class='add'>it</span> wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_19">19&#160;</span> But Mary kept all these things, and pondered <span class='add'>them</span> in her heart. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_20">20&#160;</span> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_21">21&#160;</span> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_22">22&#160;</span> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present <span class='add'>him</span> to the Lord; 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_23">23&#160;</span>(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_24">24&#160;</span> And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_25">25&#160;</span> And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name <span class='add'>was</span> Simeon; and the same man <span class='add'>was</span> just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_26">26&#160;</span> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_27">27&#160;</span> And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_28">28&#160;</span> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_29">29&#160;</span> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_30">30&#160;</span> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_31">31&#160;</span> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_32">32&#160;</span> A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_33">33&#160;</span> And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_34">34&#160;</span> And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this <span class='add'>child</span> is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_35">35&#160;</span>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_36">36&#160;</span> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_37">37&#160;</span> And she <span class='add'>was</span> a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served <span class='add'>God</span> with fastings and prayers night and day. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_38">38&#160;</span> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_39">39&#160;</span> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_40">40&#160;</span> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_41">41&#160;</span> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_42">42&#160;</span> And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_43">43&#160;</span> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <span class='add'>of it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_44">44&#160;</span> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among <span class='add'>their</span> kinsfolk and acquaintance. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_45">45&#160;</span> And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_46">46&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_47">47&#160;</span> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_48">48&#160;</span> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_49">49&#160;</span> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business? 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_50">50&#160;</span> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_51">51&#160;</span> And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. 
<span class="verse" id="LK2_52">52&#160;</span> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK3_1">1&#160;</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_2">2&#160;</span> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_3">3&#160;</span> And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_4">4&#160;</span> As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

<span class="verse" id="LK3_8">8&#160;</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <span class='add'>our</span> father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_9">9&#160;</span> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_10">10&#160;</span> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_11">11&#160;</span> He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_12">12&#160;</span> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?

<span class="verse" id="LK3_14">14&#160;</span> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse <span class='add'>any</span> falsely; and be content with your wages. 
<span class="verse" id="LK3_15">15&#160;</span> And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

<span class="verse" id="LK3_17">17&#160;</span> Whose fan <span class='add'>is</span> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

<span class="verse" id="LK5_3">3&#160;</span> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_4">4&#160;</span> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_5">5&#160;</span> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_6">6&#160;</span> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_7">7&#160;</span> And they beckoned unto <span class='add'>their</span> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_8">8&#160;</span> When Simon Peter saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

<span class="verse" id="LK5_12">12&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <span class='add'>his</span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_13">13&#160;</span> And he put forth <span class='add'>his</span> hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_14">14&#160;</span> And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_15">15&#160;</span> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK5_19">19&#160;</span> And when they could not find by what <span class='add'>way</span> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <span class='add'>his</span> couch into the midst before Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_20">20&#160;</span> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_21">21&#160;</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
<span class="verse" id="LK5_22">22&#160;</span> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

<span class="verse" id="LK6_9">9&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy <span class='add'>it</span>? 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_10">10&#160;</span> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_11">11&#160;</span> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_12">12&#160;</span> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK6_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And when it was day, he called <span class='add'>unto him</span> his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_14">14&#160;</span> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_15">15&#160;</span> Matthew and Thomas, James the <span class='add'>son</span> of Alphæus, and Simon called Zelotes, 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_16">16&#160;</span> And Judas <span class='add'>the brother</span> of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK6_17">17&#160;</span>¶ And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judæa and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_18">18&#160;</span> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_19">19&#160;</span> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed <span class='add'>them</span> all. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK6_20">20&#160;</span>¶ And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed <span class='add'>be ye</span> poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_21">21&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>are ye</span> that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed <span class='add'>are ye</span> that weep now: for ye shall laugh. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_22">22&#160;</span> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you <span class='add'>from their company</span>, and shall reproach <span class='add'>you</span>, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_23">23&#160;</span> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward <span class='add'>is</span> great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_24">24&#160;</span> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_25">25&#160;</span> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_26">26&#160;</span> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK6_27">27&#160;</span> ¶ But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_28">28&#160;</span> Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_29">29&#160;</span> And unto him that smiteth thee on the <span class='add'>one</span> cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not <span class='add'>to take thy</span> coat also.

<span class="verse" id="LK6_31">31&#160;</span> And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_32">32&#160;</span> For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_33">33&#160;</span> And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_34">34&#160;</span> And if ye lend <span class='add'>to them</span> of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_35">35&#160;</span> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and <span class='add'>to</span> the evil. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_36">36&#160;</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_37">37&#160;</span> Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_38">38&#160;</span> Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_39">39&#160;</span> And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

<span class="verse" id="LK6_43">43&#160;</span> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_44">44&#160;</span> For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_45">45&#160;</span> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK6_46">46&#160;</span> ¶ And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_47">47&#160;</span> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_48">48&#160;</span> He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 
<span class="verse" id="LK6_49">49&#160;</span> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK7_1">1&#160;</span> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_2">2&#160;</span> And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_3">3&#160;</span> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_4">4&#160;</span> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_5">5&#160;</span> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_6">6&#160;</span> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_7">7&#160;</span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_8">8&#160;</span> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <span class='add'>it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_9">9&#160;</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_10">10&#160;</span> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK7_11">11&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_12">12&#160;</span> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_13">13&#160;</span> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_14">14&#160;</span> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <span class='add'>him</span> stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_15">15&#160;</span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_16">16&#160;</span> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_17">17&#160;</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_18">18&#160;</span> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK7_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And John calling <span class='add'>unto him</span> two of his disciples sent <span class='add'>them</span> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_20">20&#160;</span> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_21">21&#160;</span> And in that same hour he cured many of <span class='add'>their</span> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <span class='add'>that were</span> blind he gave sight. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_22">22&#160;</span> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_23">23&#160;</span> And blessed is <span class='add'>he</span>, whosoever shall not be offended in me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK7_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_25">25&#160;</span> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_26">26&#160;</span> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_27">27&#160;</span> This is <span class='add'>he</span>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_28">28&#160;</span> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_29">29&#160;</span> And all the people that heard <span class='add'>him</span>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_30">30&#160;</span> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK7_31">31&#160;</span>¶ And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

<span class="verse" id="LK7_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_37">37&#160;</span> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <span class='add'>Jesus</span> sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

<span class="verse" id="LK7_39">39&#160;</span> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <span class='add'>this is</span> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_40">40&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_41">41&#160;</span> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_42">42&#160;</span> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_43">43&#160;</span> Simon answered and said, I suppose that <span class='add'>he</span>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_44">44&#160;</span> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <span class='add'>them</span> with the hairs of her head. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_45">45&#160;</span> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

<span class="verse" id="LK7_47">47&#160;</span> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <span class='add'>the same</span> loveth little. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_48">48&#160;</span> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_49">49&#160;</span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 
<span class="verse" id="LK7_50">50&#160;</span> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK8_4">4&#160;</span>¶ And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_5">5&#160;</span> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_6">6&#160;</span> And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_7">7&#160;</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_8">8&#160;</span> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_9">9&#160;</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_10">10&#160;</span> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_11">11&#160;</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_12">12&#160;</span> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_13">13&#160;</span> They on the rock <span class='add'>are they</span>, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_14">14&#160;</span> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of <span class='add'>this</span> life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_15">15&#160;</span> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep <span class='add'>it</span>, and bring forth fruit with patience. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK8_16">16&#160;</span> ¶ No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth <span class='add'>it</span> under a bed; but setteth <span class='add'>it</span> on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_17">17&#160;</span> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither <span class='add'>any thing</span> hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_18">18&#160;</span> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK8_22">22&#160;</span>¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

<span class="verse" id="LK8_24">24&#160;</span> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_25">25&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK8_28">28&#160;</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_29">29&#160;</span>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_30">30&#160;</span> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_31">31&#160;</span> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_32">32&#160;</span> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_33">33&#160;</span> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_34">34&#160;</span> When they that fed <span class='add'>them</span> saw what was done, they fled, and went and told <span class='add'>it</span> in the city and in the country. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_35">35&#160;</span> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_36">36&#160;</span> They also which saw <span class='add'>it</span> told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK8_41">41&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_42">42&#160;</span> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK8_43">43&#160;</span>¶ And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_44">44&#160;</span> Came behind <span class='add'>him</span>, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_45">45&#160;</span> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press <span class='add'>thee</span>, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_46">46&#160;</span> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_47">47&#160;</span> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_48">48&#160;</span> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK8_49">49&#160;</span>¶ While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s <span class='add'>house</span>, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_50">50&#160;</span> But when Jesus heard <span class='add'>it</span>, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_51">51&#160;</span> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_52">52&#160;</span> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_53">53&#160;</span> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_54">54&#160;</span> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. 
<span class="verse" id="LK8_55">55&#160;</span> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.

<span class="verse" id="LK9_1">1&#160;</span> Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_2">2&#160;</span> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_3">3&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Take nothing for <span class='add'>your</span> journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_4">4&#160;</span> And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_5">5&#160;</span> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_7">7&#160;</span>¶ Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;

<span class="verse" id="LK9_10">10&#160;</span>¶ And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_11">11&#160;</span> And the people, when they knew <span class='add'>it</span>, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_12">12&#160;</span> And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_13">13&#160;</span> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_14">14&#160;</span> For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_15">15&#160;</span> And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_16">16&#160;</span> Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_17">17&#160;</span> And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_18">18&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_19">19&#160;</span> They answering said, John the Baptist; but some <span class='add'>say</span>, Elias; and others <span class='add'>say</span>, that one of the old prophets is risen again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_20">20&#160;</span> He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_21">21&#160;</span> And he straitly charged them, and commanded <span class='add'>them</span> to tell no man that thing; 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_22">22&#160;</span> Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_23">23&#160;</span>¶ And he said to <span class='add'>them</span> all, If any <span class='add'>man</span> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_24">24&#160;</span> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

<span class="verse" id="LK9_26">26&#160;</span> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and <span class='add'>in his</span> Father’s, and of the holy angels. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_27">27&#160;</span> But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_28">28&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_29">29&#160;</span> And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <span class='add'>was</span> white <span class='add'>and</span> glistering. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_30">30&#160;</span> And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_31">31&#160;</span> Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_32">32&#160;</span> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_33">33&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_34">34&#160;</span> While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_35">35&#160;</span> And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_36">36&#160;</span> And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_37">37&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_38">38&#160;</span> And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_39">39&#160;</span> And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_40">40&#160;</span> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_41">41&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_42">42&#160;</span> And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare <span class='add'>him</span>. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_43">43&#160;</span>¶ And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_44">44&#160;</span> Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_45">45&#160;</span> But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_46">46&#160;</span>¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_47">47&#160;</span> And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_48">48&#160;</span> And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_49">49&#160;</span>¶ And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_50">50&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, Forbid <span class='add'>him</span> not: for he that is not against us is for us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_51">51&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_52">52&#160;</span> And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_53">53&#160;</span> And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_54">54&#160;</span> And when his disciples James and John saw <span class='add'>this</span>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_55">55&#160;</span> But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_56">56&#160;</span> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save <span class='add'>them</span>. And they went to another village. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK9_57">57&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain <span class='add'>man</span> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_58">58&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air <span class='add'>have</span> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <span class='add'>his</span> head. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_59">59&#160;</span> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_60">60&#160;</span> Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_61">61&#160;</span> And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK9_62">62&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='LK10_0'> 10</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK10_1">1&#160;</span> After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_2">2&#160;</span> Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly <span class='add'>is</span> great, but the labourers <span class='add'>are</span> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_3">3&#160;</span> Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_4">4&#160;</span> Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_5">5&#160;</span> And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace <span class='add'>be</span> to this house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_6">6&#160;</span> And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_7">7&#160;</span> And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_8">8&#160;</span> And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_9">9&#160;</span> And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_10">10&#160;</span> But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_11">11&#160;</span> Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_12">12&#160;</span> But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_13">13&#160;</span> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

<span class="verse" id="LK10_15">15&#160;</span> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_16">16&#160;</span> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK10_17">17&#160;</span>¶ And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_18">18&#160;</span> And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_19">19&#160;</span> Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_20">20&#160;</span> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK10_21">21&#160;</span>¶ In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_22">22&#160;</span> All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and <span class='add'>he</span> to whom the Son will reveal <span class='add'>him.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK10_23">23&#160;</span>¶ And he turned him unto <span class='add'>his</span> disciples, and said privately, Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the eyes which see the things that ye see: 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_24">24&#160;</span> For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen <span class='add'>them</span>; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard <span class='add'>them.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK10_25">25&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_26">26&#160;</span> He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_27">27&#160;</span> And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_28">28&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_29">29&#160;</span> But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_30">30&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said, A certain <span class='add'> man</span> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded <span class='add'>him</span>, and departed, leaving <span class='add'>him</span> half dead. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_31">31&#160;</span> And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_32">32&#160;</span> And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked <span class='add'>on him</span>, and passed by on the other side. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_33">33&#160;</span> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion <span class='add'>on him</span>, 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_34">34&#160;</span> And went to <span class='add'>him</span>, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_35">35&#160;</span> And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave <span class='add'>them</span> to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK10_36">36&#160;</span> Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?

<span class="verse" id="LK10_38">38&#160;</span>¶ Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

<span class="verse" id="LK10_40">40&#160;</span> But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

<span class="verse" id="LK11_5">5&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

<span class="verse" id="LK11_7">7&#160;</span> And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK11_8">8&#160;</span> I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.

<span class="verse" id="LK16_3">3&#160;</span> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK16_4">4&#160;</span> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

<span class="verse" id="LK18_1">1&#160;</span> And he spake a parable unto them <span class='add'>to this end</span>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_2">2&#160;</span> Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_3">3&#160;</span> And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_4">4&#160;</span> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_5">5&#160;</span> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_6">6&#160;</span> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_7">7&#160;</span> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_8">8&#160;</span> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_9">9&#160;</span> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_10">10&#160;</span> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_11">11&#160;</span> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <span class='add'>are</span>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_12">12&#160;</span> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_13">13&#160;</span> And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <span class='add'>his</span> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_14">14&#160;</span> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <span class='add'>rather</span> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_15">15&#160;</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <span class='add'>his</span> disciples saw <span class='add'>it</span>, they rebuked them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_16">16&#160;</span> But Jesus called them <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_17">17&#160;</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_18">18&#160;</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_19">19&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none <span class='add'>is</span> good, save one, <span class='add'>that is</span>, God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_20">20&#160;</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_21">21&#160;</span> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_22">22&#160;</span> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_23">23&#160;</span> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_24">24&#160;</span> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_25">25&#160;</span> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_26">26&#160;</span> And they that heard <span class='add'>it</span> said, Who then can be saved? 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_27">27&#160;</span> And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_28">28&#160;</span> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_29">29&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake, 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_30">30&#160;</span> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK18_31">31&#160;</span>¶ Then he took <span class='add'>unto him</span> the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_32">32&#160;</span> For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_33">33&#160;</span> And they shall scourge <span class='add'>him</span>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_34">34&#160;</span> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK18_35">35&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_36">36&#160;</span> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_37">37&#160;</span> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_38">38&#160;</span> And he cried, saying, Jesus, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_39">39&#160;</span> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <span class='add'>Thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_40">40&#160;</span> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_41">41&#160;</span> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_42">42&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. 
<span class="verse" id="LK18_43">43&#160;</span> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <span class='add'>it</span>, gave praise unto God.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='LK19_0'> 19</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK19_1">1&#160;</span> And <span class='add'>Jesus</span> entered and passed through Jericho. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_2">2&#160;</span> And, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a man named Zacchæus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_3">3&#160;</span> And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_4">4&#160;</span> And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that <span class='add'>way</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_5">5&#160;</span> And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_6">6&#160;</span> And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_7">7&#160;</span> And when they saw <span class='add'>it</span>, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_8">8&#160;</span> And Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore <span class='add'>him</span> fourfold. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_9">9&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_10">10&#160;</span> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_11">11&#160;</span> And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_12">12&#160;</span> He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_13">13&#160;</span> And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_14">14&#160;</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this <span class='add'>man</span> to reign over us. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_15">15&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_16">16&#160;</span> Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_17">17&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_18">18&#160;</span> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_19">19&#160;</span> And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_20">20&#160;</span> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, <span class='add'>here is</span> thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_21">21&#160;</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_22">22&#160;</span> And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, <span class='add'>thou</span> wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_23">23&#160;</span> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_24">24&#160;</span> And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give <span class='add'>it</span> to him that hath ten pounds. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_25">25&#160;</span> (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_26">26&#160;</span> For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_27">27&#160;</span> But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay <span class='add'>them</span> before me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK19_28">28&#160;</span>¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_29">29&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called <span class='add'>the mount</span> of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_30">30&#160;</span> Saying, Go ye into the village over against <span class='add'>you</span>; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring <span class='add'>him hither</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_31">31&#160;</span> And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose <span class='add'>him</span>? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_32">32&#160;</span> And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_33">33&#160;</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_34">34&#160;</span> And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_35">35&#160;</span> And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_36">36&#160;</span> And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_37">37&#160;</span> And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_38">38&#160;</span> Saying, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_39">39&#160;</span> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_40">40&#160;</span> And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK19_41">41&#160;</span>¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_42">42&#160;</span> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things <span class='add'>which belong</span> unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_43">43&#160;</span> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_44">44&#160;</span> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_45">45&#160;</span> And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_46">46&#160;</span> Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_47">47&#160;</span> And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 
<span class="verse" id="LK19_48">48&#160;</span> And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK20_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon <span class='add'>him</span> with the elders, 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_2">2&#160;</span> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_3">3&#160;</span> And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_4">4&#160;</span> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_5">5&#160;</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_6">6&#160;</span> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_7">7&#160;</span> And they answered, that they could not tell whence <span class='add'>it was</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_8">8&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_9">9&#160;</span> Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_10">10&#160;</span> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent <span class='add'>him</span> away empty. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_11">11&#160;</span> And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated <span class='add'>him</span> shamefully, and sent <span class='add'>him</span> away empty. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_12">12&#160;</span> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast <span class='add'>him</span> out. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_13">13&#160;</span> Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence <span class='add'>him</span> when they see him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_14">14&#160;</span> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_15">15&#160;</span> So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed <span class='add'>him</span>. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_16">16&#160;</span> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they said, God forbid. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_17">17&#160;</span> And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_18">18&#160;</span> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK20_19">19&#160;</span>¶ And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_20">20&#160;</span> And they watched <span class='add'>him</span>, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_21">21&#160;</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person <span class='add'>of any</span>, but teachest the way of God truly: 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_22">22&#160;</span> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cæsar, or no? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_23">23&#160;</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_24">24&#160;</span> Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Cæsar’s. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_25">25&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_26">26&#160;</span> And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK20_27">27&#160;</span>¶ Then came to <span class='add'>him</span> certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_28">28&#160;</span> Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_29">29&#160;</span> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_30">30&#160;</span> And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_31">31&#160;</span> And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_32">32&#160;</span> Last of all the woman died also. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_33">33&#160;</span> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_34">34&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_35">35&#160;</span> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_36">36&#160;</span> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_37">37&#160;</span> Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_38">38&#160;</span> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK20_39">39&#160;</span>¶ Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_40">40&#160;</span> And after that they durst not ask him any <span class='add'>question at all</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_41">41&#160;</span> And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son? 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_42">42&#160;</span> And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_43">43&#160;</span> Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK20_45">45&#160;</span>¶ Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
<span class="verse" id="LK20_46">46&#160;</span> Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

<span class="verse" id="LK21_6">6&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As for</span> these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_7">7&#160;</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign <span class='add'> will there be</span> when these things shall come to pass? 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_8">8&#160;</span> And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am <span class='add'>Christ</span>; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_9">9&#160;</span> But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end <span class='add'>is</span> not by and by. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_10">10&#160;</span> Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_11">11&#160;</span> And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_12">12&#160;</span> But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute <span class='add'>you</span>, delivering <span class='add'>you</span> up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_13">13&#160;</span> And it shall turn to you for a testimony. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_14">14&#160;</span> Settle <span class='add'>it</span> therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_15">15&#160;</span> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

<span class="verse" id="LK21_17">17&#160;</span> And ye shall be hated of all <span class='add'>men</span> for my name’s sake. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_18">18&#160;</span> But there shall not an hair of your head perish. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_19">19&#160;</span> In your patience possess ye your souls. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_20">20&#160;</span> And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_21">21&#160;</span> Then let them which are in Judæa flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_22">22&#160;</span> For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_23">23&#160;</span> But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_24">24&#160;</span> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK21_25">25&#160;</span> ¶ And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_26">26&#160;</span> Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_27">27&#160;</span> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_28">28&#160;</span> And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_29">29&#160;</span> And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;

<span class="verse" id="LK21_37">37&#160;</span> And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called <span class='add'>the mount</span> of Olives. 
<span class="verse" id="LK21_38">38&#160;</span> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_3">3&#160;</span>¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_4">4&#160;</span> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_5">5&#160;</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_6">6&#160;</span> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_7">7&#160;</span>¶ Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

<span class="verse" id="LK22_9">9&#160;</span> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_10">10&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_11">11&#160;</span> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_12">12&#160;</span> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_13">13&#160;</span> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_14">14&#160;</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_15">15&#160;</span> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_16">16&#160;</span> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_17">17&#160;</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide <span class='add'>it</span> among yourselves:

<span class="verse" id="LK22_24">24&#160;</span>¶ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_25">25&#160;</span> And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_26">26&#160;</span> But ye <span class='add'>shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

<span class="verse" id="LK22_31">31&#160;</span>¶ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <span class='add'>to have</span> you, that he may sift <span class='add'>you</span> as wheat: 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_32">32&#160;</span> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_33">33&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_34">34&#160;</span> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

<span class="verse" id="LK22_39">39&#160;</span>¶ And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_40">40&#160;</span> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_41">41&#160;</span> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_42">42&#160;</span> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_43">43&#160;</span> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_44">44&#160;</span> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_45">45&#160;</span> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_46">46&#160;</span> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK22_47">47&#160;</span>¶ And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_48">48&#160;</span> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_49">49&#160;</span> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_50">50&#160;</span>¶ And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_51">51&#160;</span> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_52">52&#160;</span> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_53">53&#160;</span> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_54">54&#160;</span>¶ Then took they him, and led <span class='add'>him</span>, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_55">55&#160;</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_56">56&#160;</span> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_57">57&#160;</span> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_58">58&#160;</span> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_59">59&#160;</span> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this <span class='add'>fellow</span> also was with him: for he is a Galilæan. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_60">60&#160;</span> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_61">61&#160;</span> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_62">62&#160;</span> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_63">63&#160;</span>¶ And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote <span class='add'>him</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_64">64&#160;</span> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_65">65&#160;</span> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK22_66">66&#160;</span>¶ And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_67">67&#160;</span> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_68">68&#160;</span> And if I also ask <span class='add'>you</span>, ye will not answer me, nor let <span class='add'>me</span> go. 
<span class="verse" id="LK22_69">69&#160;</span> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.

<span class="verse" id="LK22_71">71&#160;</span> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="LK23_1">1&#160;</span> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_2">2&#160;</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <span class='add'>fellow</span> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_3">3&#160;</span> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest <span class='add'>it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_4">4&#160;</span> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <span class='add'>to</span> the people, I find no fault in this man. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_5">5&#160;</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_6">6&#160;</span> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_7">7&#160;</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <span class='add'>season</span>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_9">9&#160;</span> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_10">10&#160;</span> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_11">11&#160;</span> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <span class='add'>him</span>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_12">12&#160;</span>¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_14">14&#160;</span> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <span class='add'>him</span> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_15">15&#160;</span> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_16">16&#160;</span> I will therefore chastise him, and release <span class='add'>him</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_17">17&#160;</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_18">18&#160;</span> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <span class='add'>man</span>, and release unto us Barabbas: 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_19">19&#160;</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_20">20&#160;</span> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_21">21&#160;</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify <span class='add'>him</span>, crucify him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_22">22&#160;</span> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <span class='add'>him</span> go. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_23">23&#160;</span> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_24">24&#160;</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_25">25&#160;</span> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_26">26&#160;</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <span class='add'>it</span> after Jesus. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_27">27&#160;</span>¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_28">28&#160;</span> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_29">29&#160;</span> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_30">30&#160;</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_31">31&#160;</span> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_32">32&#160;</span> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_33">33&#160;</span> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_34">34&#160;</span>¶ Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_35">35&#160;</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <span class='add'>him</span>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_36">36&#160;</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_37">37&#160;</span> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_38">38&#160;</span> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_39">39&#160;</span>¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_40">40&#160;</span> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_41">41&#160;</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_42">42&#160;</span> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_43">43&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_44">44&#160;</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_45">45&#160;</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_46">46&#160;</span>¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_47">47&#160;</span> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_48">48&#160;</span> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_49">49&#160;</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK23_50">50&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <span class='add'>and he was</span> a good man, and a just: 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_51">51&#160;</span>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <span class='add'>he was</span> of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_52">52&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>man</span> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_53">53&#160;</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_54">54&#160;</span> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_55">55&#160;</span> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
<span class="verse" id="LK23_56">56&#160;</span> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='LK24_0'> 24</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK24_1">1&#160;</span> Now upon the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <span class='add'>others</span> with them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_2">2&#160;</span> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_3">3&#160;</span> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_4">4&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_5">5&#160;</span> And as they were afraid, and bowed down <span class='add'>their</span> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_6">6&#160;</span> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_7">7&#160;</span> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_8">8&#160;</span> And they remembered his words, 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_9">9&#160;</span> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_10">10&#160;</span> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <span class='add'>the mother</span> of James, and other <span class='add'>women that were</span> with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_11">11&#160;</span> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_12">12&#160;</span> Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK24_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <span class='add'>about</span> threescore furlongs. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_14">14&#160;</span> And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_15">15&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that, while they communed <span class='add'>together</span> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_16">16&#160;</span> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_17">17&#160;</span> And he said unto them, What manner of communications <span class='add'>are</span> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_18">18&#160;</span> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_19">19&#160;</span> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_20">20&#160;</span> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_21">21&#160;</span> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_22">22&#160;</span> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_23">23&#160;</span> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_24">24&#160;</span> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <span class='add'>it</span> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_25">25&#160;</span> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_26">26&#160;</span> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_27">27&#160;</span> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_28">28&#160;</span> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_29">29&#160;</span> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_30">30&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <span class='add'>it</span>, and brake, and gave to them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_31">31&#160;</span> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_32">32&#160;</span> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_33">33&#160;</span> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_34">34&#160;</span> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_35">35&#160;</span> And they told what things <span class='add'>were done</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK24_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_37">37&#160;</span> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_38">38&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_39">39&#160;</span> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_40">40&#160;</span> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <span class='add'>his</span> hands and <span class='add'>his</span> feet. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_41">41&#160;</span> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_42">42&#160;</span> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_43">43&#160;</span> And he took <span class='add'>it</span>, and did eat before them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_44">44&#160;</span> And he said unto them, These <span class='add'>are</span> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <span class='add'>in</span> the prophets, and <span class='add'>in</span> the psalms, concerning me. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_45">45&#160;</span> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_46">46&#160;</span> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_47">47&#160;</span> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_48">48&#160;</span> And ye are witnesses of these things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK24_49">49&#160;</span> ¶ And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="LK24_50">50&#160;</span>¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_51">51&#160;</span> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_52">52&#160;</span> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
<span class="verse" id="LK24_53">53&#160;</span> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. </div><div class="footnote">
