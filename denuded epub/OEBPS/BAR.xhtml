<span class="verse" id="BR1_1">1&#160;</span>And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_2">2&#160;</span>In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_3">3&#160;</span>And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_4">4&#160;</span>And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king’s sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_5">5&#160;</span>Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_6">6&#160;</span>They made also a collection of money according to every man’s power: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_7">7&#160;</span>And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_8">8&#160;</span>At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_9">9&#160;</span>After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_10">10&#160;</span>And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_11">11&#160;</span>And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favour in their sight. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_13">13&#160;</span>Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_14">14&#160;</span>And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_15">15&#160;</span>And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, </div>

<span class="verse" id="BR1_16">16&#160;</span>And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers: </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_18">18&#160;</span>And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_19">19&#160;</span>Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_21">21&#160;</span>Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sent unto us: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR1_22">22&#160;</span>But every man followed the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='BR2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_1">1&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_2">2&#160;</span>To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that were written in the law of Moses; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_3">3&#160;</span>That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_4">4&#160;</span>Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_5">5&#160;</span>Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto his voice. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_6">6&#160;</span>To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto us and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_7">7&#160;</span>For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord hath pronounced against us </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_8">8&#160;</span>Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_9">9&#160;</span>Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he hath commanded us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_10">10&#160;</span>Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_11">11&#160;</span>And now, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and hast gotten thyself a name, as appeareth this day: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_12">12&#160;</span>O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_13">13&#160;</span>Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_14">14&#160;</span>Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which have led us away: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_15">15&#160;</span>That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_16">16&#160;</span>O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bow down thine ear, O Lord, to hear us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_17">17&#160;</span>Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_18">18&#160;</span>But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_19">19&#160;</span>Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_20">20&#160;</span>For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_21">21&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto your fathers. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_22">22&#160;</span>But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_23">23&#160;</span>I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_24">24&#160;</span>But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_25">25&#160;</span>And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_26">26&#160;</span>And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_27">27&#160;</span>O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thy goodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_28">28&#160;</span>As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_29">29&#160;</span>If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_30">30&#160;</span>For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_31">31&#160;</span>And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_32">32&#160;</span>And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_33">33&#160;</span>And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_34">34&#160;</span>And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="BR2_35">35&#160;</span>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them.  </div>
