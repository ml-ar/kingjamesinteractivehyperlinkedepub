<div class='mt'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RM1_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="RM1_1">1&#160;</span> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <span class='add'>to be</span> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
<span class="verse" id="RM1_2">2&#160;</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
<span class="verse" id="RM1_3">3&#160;</span> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
<span class="verse" id="RM1_4">4&#160;</span> And declared <span class='add'>to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_5">5&#160;</span> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_6">6&#160;</span> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_7">7&#160;</span> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <span class='add'>to be</span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM1_8">8&#160;</span> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_9">9&#160;</span> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
<span class="verse" id="RM1_10">10&#160;</span> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_11">11&#160;</span> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
<span class="verse" id="RM1_12">12&#160;</span> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_13">13&#160;</span> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_14">14&#160;</span> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_15">15&#160;</span> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_16">16&#160;</span> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_17">17&#160;</span> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM1_18">18&#160;</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
<span class="verse" id="RM1_19">19&#160;</span> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <span class='add'>it</span> unto them.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_20">20&#160;</span> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <span class='add'>even</span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_21">21&#160;</span> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <span class='add'>him</span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_22">22&#160;</span> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
<span class="verse" id="RM1_23">23&#160;</span> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM1_24">24&#160;</span> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_25">25&#160;</span> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_26">26&#160;</span> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_27">27&#160;</span> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
<span class="verse" id="RM1_28">28&#160;</span> And even as they did not like to retain God in <span class='add'>their</span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
<span class="verse" id="RM1_29">29&#160;</span> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
<span class="verse" id="RM1_30">30&#160;</span> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
<span class="verse" id="RM1_31">31&#160;</span> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
<span class="verse" id="RM1_32">32&#160;</span> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RM2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM2_1">1&#160;</span> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_2">2&#160;</span> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_3">3&#160;</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_4">4&#160;</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_5">5&#160;</span> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
<span class="verse" id="RM2_6">6&#160;</span> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
<span class="verse" id="RM2_7">7&#160;</span> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
<span class="verse" id="RM2_8">8&#160;</span> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
<span class="verse" id="RM2_9">9&#160;</span> Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
<span class="verse" id="RM2_10">10&#160;</span> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
<span class="verse" id="RM2_11">11&#160;</span> For there is no respect of persons with God.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_12">12&#160;</span> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
<span class="verse" id="RM2_13">13&#160;</span>(For not the hearers of the law <span class='add'>are</span> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_14">14&#160;</span> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
<span class="verse" id="RM2_15">15&#160;</span> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <span class='add'>their</span> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
<span class="verse" id="RM2_16">16&#160;</span> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM2_17">17&#160;</span> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
<span class="verse" id="RM2_18">18&#160;</span> And knowest <span class='add'>his</span> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
<span class="verse" id="RM2_19">19&#160;</span> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
<span class="verse" id="RM2_20">20&#160;</span> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_21">21&#160;</span> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_22">22&#160;</span> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_23">23&#160;</span> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_24">24&#160;</span> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_25">25&#160;</span> For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
<span class="verse" id="RM2_26">26&#160;</span> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_27">27&#160;</span> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
<span class="verse" id="RM2_28">28&#160;</span> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <span class='add'>is that</span> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
<span class="verse" id="RM2_29">29&#160;</span> But he <span class='add'>is</span> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <span class='add'>is that</span> of the heart, in the spirit, <span class='add'>and</span> not in the letter; whose praise <span class='add'>is</span> not of men, but of God.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RM3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM3_1">1&#160;</span> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <span class='add'>is there</span> of circumcision?
<span class="verse" id="RM3_2">2&#160;</span> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_3">3&#160;</span> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
<span class="verse" id="RM3_4">4&#160;</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_5">5&#160;</span> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <span class='add'>Is</span> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
<span class="verse" id="RM3_6">6&#160;</span> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
<span class="verse" id="RM3_7">7&#160;</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
<span class="verse" id="RM3_8">8&#160;</span> And not <span class='add'>rather</span>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM3_9">9&#160;</span> What then? are we better <span class='add'>than they</span>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
<span class="verse" id="RM3_10">10&#160;</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_11">11&#160;</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_12">12&#160;</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_13">13&#160;</span> Their throat <span class='add'>is</span> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <span class='add'>is</span> under their lips:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_14">14&#160;</span> Whose mouth <span class='add'>is</span> full of cursing and bitterness:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_15">15&#160;</span> Their feet <span class='add'>are</span> swift to shed blood:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_16">16&#160;</span> Destruction and misery <span class='add'>are</span> in their ways:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_17">17&#160;</span> And the way of peace have they not known:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_18">18&#160;</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM3_19">19&#160;</span> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_20">20&#160;</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <span class='add'>is</span> the knowledge of sin. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM3_21">21&#160;</span> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
<span class="verse" id="RM3_22">22&#160;</span> Even the righteousness of God <span class='add'>which is</span> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_23">23&#160;</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
<span class="verse" id="RM3_24">24&#160;</span> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_25">25&#160;</span> Whom God hath set forth <span class='add'>to be</span> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
<span class="verse" id="RM3_26">26&#160;</span> To declare, <span class='add'>I say</span>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_27">27&#160;</span> Where <span class='add'>is</span> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_28">28&#160;</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_29">29&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is he</span> the God of the Jews only? <span class='add'>is he</span> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
<span class="verse" id="RM3_30">30&#160;</span> Seeing <span class='add'>it is</span> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
<span class="verse" id="RM3_31">31&#160;</span> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RM4_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM4_1">1&#160;</span> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
<span class="verse" id="RM4_2">2&#160;</span> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <span class='add'>whereof</span> to glory; but not before God.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_3">3&#160;</span> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_4">4&#160;</span> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_5">5&#160;</span> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_6">6&#160;</span> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
<span class="verse" id="RM4_7">7&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Saying</span>, Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_8">8&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_9">9&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Cometh</span> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <span class='add'>only</span>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_10">10&#160;</span> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_11">11&#160;</span> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <span class='add'>he had yet</span> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
<span class="verse" id="RM4_12">12&#160;</span> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <span class='add'>he had</span> being <span class='add'>yet</span> uncircumcised.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_13">13&#160;</span> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <span class='add'>was</span> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_14">14&#160;</span> For if they which are of the law <span class='add'>be</span> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
<span class="verse" id="RM4_15">15&#160;</span> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <span class='add'>there is</span> no transgression.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_16">16&#160;</span> Therefore <span class='add'>it is</span> of faith, that <span class='add'>it might be</span> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
<span class="verse" id="RM4_17">17&#160;</span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <span class='add'>even</span> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_18">18&#160;</span> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_19">19&#160;</span> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb:
<span class="verse" id="RM4_20">20&#160;</span> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
<span class="verse" id="RM4_21">21&#160;</span> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_22">22&#160;</span> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM4_23">23&#160;</span> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
<span class="verse" id="RM4_24">24&#160;</span> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
<span class="verse" id="RM4_25">25&#160;</span> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RM5_0'> 5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM5_1">1&#160;</span> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
<span class="verse" id="RM5_2">2&#160;</span> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_3">3&#160;</span> And not only <span class='add'>so</span>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
<span class="verse" id="RM5_4">4&#160;</span> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
<span class="verse" id="RM5_5">5&#160;</span> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_6">6&#160;</span> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_7">7&#160;</span> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_8">8&#160;</span> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_9">9&#160;</span> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_10">10&#160;</span> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_11">11&#160;</span> And not only <span class='add'>so</span>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RM5_12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
<span class="verse" id="RM5_13">13&#160;</span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_14">14&#160;</span> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_15">15&#160;</span> But not as the offence, so also <span class='add'>is</span> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <span class='add'>which is</span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_16">16&#160;</span> And not as <span class='add'>it was</span> by one that sinned, <span class='add'>so is</span> the gift: for the judgment <span class='add'>was</span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <span class='add'>is</span> of many offences unto justification.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_17">17&#160;</span> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
<span class="verse" id="RM5_18">18&#160;</span> Therefore as by the offence of one <span class='add'>judgment came</span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <span class='add'>the free gift came</span> upon all men unto justification of life.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_19">19&#160;</span> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
<span class="verse" id="RM5_20">20&#160;</span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
<span class="verse" id="RM5_21">21&#160;</span> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="RM6_1">1&#160;</span> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
<span class="verse" id="RM6_2">2&#160;</span> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
<span class="verse" id="RM6_3">3&#160;</span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
<span class="verse" id="RM6_4">4&#160;</span> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_5">5&#160;</span> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <span class='add'>in the likeness</span> of <span class='add'>his</span> resurrection:
<span class="verse" id="RM6_6">6&#160;</span> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <span class='add'>him</span>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_7">7&#160;</span> For he that is dead is freed from sin.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_8">8&#160;</span> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
<span class="verse" id="RM6_9">9&#160;</span> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_10">10&#160;</span> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_11">11&#160;</span> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_12">12&#160;</span> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_13">13&#160;</span> Neither yield ye your members <span class='add'>as</span> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <span class='add'>as</span> instruments of righteousness unto God.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_14">14&#160;</span> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_15">15&#160;</span> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_16">16&#160;</span> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
<span class="verse" id="RM6_17">17&#160;</span> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_18">18&#160;</span> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_19">19&#160;</span> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_20">20&#160;</span> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_21">21&#160;</span> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <span class='add'>is</span> death.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_22">22&#160;</span> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
<span class="verse" id="RM6_23">23&#160;</span> For the wages of sin <span class='add'>is</span> death; but the gift of God <span class='add'>is</span> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="RM7_1">1&#160;</span> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
<span class="verse" id="RM7_2">2&#160;</span> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <span class='add'>her</span> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <span class='add'>her</span> husband.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_3">3&#160;</span> So then if, while <span class='add'>her</span> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_4">4&#160;</span> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <span class='add'>even</span> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_5">5&#160;</span> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_6">6&#160;</span> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <span class='add'>in</span> the oldness of the letter. </div>

<span class="verse" id="RM7_7">7&#160;</span> What shall we say then? <span class='add'>Is</span> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_8">8&#160;</span> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <span class='add'>was</span> dead.

<span class="verse" id="RM7_11">11&#160;</span> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <span class='add'>me</span>.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore the law <span class='add'>is</span> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
<span class="verse" id="RM7_13">13&#160;</span> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

<span class="verse" id="RM8_3">3&#160;</span> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

<span class="verse" id="RM8_31">31&#160;</span> What shall we then say to these things? If God <span class='add'>be</span> for us, who <span class='add'>can be</span> against us?
