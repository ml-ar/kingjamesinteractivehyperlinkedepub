<span class="verse" id="E23_17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E24_1">1&#160;</span>And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E24_2">2&#160;</span>And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_3">3&#160;</span>Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_4">4&#160;</span>Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_5">5&#160;</span>And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_6">6&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_7">7&#160;</span>And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_8">8&#160;</span>Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_9">9&#160;</span>Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_13">13&#160;</span>He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel, </div>

<span class="verse" id="E24_15">15&#160;</span>The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country. </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_17">17&#160;</span>The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_19">19&#160;</span>I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_20">20&#160;</span>Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_21">21&#160;</span>For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_22">22&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_23">23&#160;</span>For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_24">24&#160;</span>And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_25">25&#160;</span>What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_26">26&#160;</span>Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_27">27&#160;</span>And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_28">28&#160;</span>But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_29">29&#160;</span>If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_30">30&#160;</span>For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_31">31&#160;</span>Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_32">32&#160;</span>And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_33">33&#160;</span>Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_34">34&#160;</span>And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_35">35&#160;</span>Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_36">36&#160;</span>And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_37">37&#160;</span>By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_38">38&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_39">39&#160;</span>And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_40">40&#160;</span>So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_41">41&#160;</span>Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_42">42&#160;</span>For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_43">43&#160;</span>From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_44">44&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_45">45&#160;</span>Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_46">46&#160;</span>What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_47">47&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_48">48&#160;</span>So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_49">49&#160;</span>After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_50">50&#160;</span>Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_51">51&#160;</span>Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E24_52">52&#160;</span>He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="E25_14">14&#160;</span>Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_34">34&#160;</span>And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_35">35&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_36">36&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_37">37&#160;</span>Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_38">38&#160;</span>And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with men? </div>

<span class="verse" id="E25_39">39&#160;</span>As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_40">40&#160;</span>Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_41">41&#160;</span>And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_42">42&#160;</span>And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is no swiftness of the first. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_43">43&#160;</span>So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_44">44&#160;</span>Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_45">45&#160;</span>And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present at once. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_46">46&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_47">47&#160;</span>And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_48">48&#160;</span>Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their times. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_49">49&#160;</span>For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E25_50">50&#160;</span>And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_51">51&#160;</span>He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_52">52&#160;</span>Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that were before, but less of stature? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_53">53&#160;</span>And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E25_54">54&#160;</span>Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you. </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_9">9&#160;</span>Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_11">11&#160;</span>And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_12">12&#160;</span>The same must know it after death by pain. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_13">13&#160;</span>And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_14">14&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_15">15&#160;</span>I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_16">16&#160;</span>Like as a wave is greater than a drop. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_17">17&#160;</span>And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman is himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_18">18&#160;</span>And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_19">19&#160;</span>For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_20">20&#160;</span>So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_21">21&#160;</span>And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_22">22&#160;</span>Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_23">23&#160;</span>Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_24">24&#160;</span>But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;) </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_25">25&#160;</span>And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_26">26&#160;</span>So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_27">27&#160;</span>After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_28">28&#160;</span>And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_29">29&#160;</span>O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_30">30&#160;</span>And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_31">31&#160;</span>For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_32">32&#160;</span>But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_33">33&#160;</span>Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_34">34&#160;</span>And, lo, it is a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_35">35&#160;</span>That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_36">36&#160;</span>For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_37">37&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_38">38&#160;</span>And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_39">39&#160;</span>Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_40">40&#160;</span>And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_41">41&#160;</span>And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_42">42&#160;</span>And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_43">43&#160;</span>She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_44">44&#160;</span>And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_45">45&#160;</span>After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_46">46&#160;</span>And I nourished him with great travail. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E29_47">47&#160;</span>So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_1">1&#160;</span>And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down, and died. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_2">2&#160;</span>Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours rose up to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day at night. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_3">3&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night and fled, and came hither into this field, as thou seest. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_4">4&#160;</span>And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_13">13&#160;</span>But the earth not so: for the multitude present in it according to the course of the earth is gone, as it came: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_14">14&#160;</span>Then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth with labour; even so the earth also hath given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning unto him that made her. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath befallen thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_16">16&#160;</span>For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to be just, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt be commended among women. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_21">21&#160;</span>For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_22">22&#160;</span>Our psaltery is laid on the ground, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones destroyed, our young men are brought in bondage, and our strong men are become weak; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_23">23&#160;</span>And, which is the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath now lost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of them that hate us. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_24">24&#160;</span>And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put away the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto thee again, and the Highest shall give thee rest and ease from thy labour. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it might be. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_26">26&#160;</span>And, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: so that the earth shook at the noise of the woman. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_27">27&#160;</span>And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared unto me no more, but there was a city builded, and a large place shewed itself from the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said, </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_31">31&#160;</span>What aileth thee? and why art thou so disquieted? and why is thine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_32">32&#160;</span>And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I did according to thy words, and I went into the field, and, lo, I have seen, and yet see, that I am not able to express. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_33">33&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Stand up manfully, and I will advise thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_34">34&#160;</span>Then said I, Speak on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_35">35&#160;</span>For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_39">39&#160;</span>He hath seen that thy way is right: for that thou sorrowest continually for thy people, and makest great lamentation for Sion. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_40">40&#160;</span>This therefore is the meaning of the vision which thou lately sawest: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_41">41&#160;</span>Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comfort her: </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_43">43&#160;</span>And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this is the solution: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_44">44&#160;</span>This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she said unto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded, </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_45">45&#160;</span>Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirty years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was no offering made in her. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_46">46&#160;</span>But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offered offerings: and then bare the barren a son. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_47">47&#160;</span>And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_48">48&#160;</span>But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into his marriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_49">49&#160;</span>And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because she mourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of these things which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_50">50&#160;</span>For now the most High seeth that thou art grieved unfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hath he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness of her beauty: </div>

<span class="verse" id="E210_51">51&#160;</span>And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no house was builded: </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_53">53&#160;</span>Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where no foundation of any building was. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_55">55&#160;</span>And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted, but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as thine eyes be able to see: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_56">56&#160;</span>And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may comprehend. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E210_57">57&#160;</span>For thou art blessed above many other, and art called with the Highest; and so are but few. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E211_1">1&#160;</span>Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_2">2&#160;</span>And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gathered together. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E211_5">5&#160;</span>Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_20">20&#160;</span>Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_21">21&#160;</span>For some of them were set up, but ruled not. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_22">22&#160;</span>After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor the two little feathers: </div>

<span class="verse" id="E211_29">29&#160;</span>And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two other heads. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_30">30&#160;</span>And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_31">31&#160;</span>And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would have reigned. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E211_32">32&#160;</span>But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E211_33">33&#160;</span>And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings. </div>

<span class="verse" id="E211_34">34&#160;</span>But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein. </div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="E212_41">41&#160;</span>What have we offended thee? and what evil have we done against thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in this place? </div>

<span class="verse" id="E212_45">45&#160;</span>For we are not better than they that died there. And they wept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said, </div>

<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_4">4&#160;</span>And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_5">5&#160;</span>And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_6">6&#160;</span>But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_8">8&#160;</span>And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_9">9&#160;</span>And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_10">10&#160;</span>But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests. </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="E213_12">12&#160;</span>Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude. </div>
