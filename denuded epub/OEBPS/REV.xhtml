<div class='mt'>THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV1_0'> 1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="RV1_1">1&#160;</span> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified <span class='add'>it</span> by his angel unto his servant John: 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_2">2&#160;</span> Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_3">3&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time <span class='add'>is</span> at hand. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_4">4&#160;</span> John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_5">5&#160;</span> And from Jesus Christ, <span class='add'>who is</span> the faithful witness, <span class='add'>and</span> the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_6">6&#160;</span> And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him <span class='add'>be</span> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_7">7&#160;</span> Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they <span class='add'>also</span> which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_8">8&#160;</span> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV1_9">9&#160;</span> I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_10">10&#160;</span> I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_11">11&#160;</span> Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send <span class='add'>it</span> unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_12">12&#160;</span> And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_13">13&#160;</span> And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <span class='add'>one</span> like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_14">14&#160;</span> His head and <span class='add'>his</span> hairs <span class='add'>were</span> white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <span class='add'>were</span> as a flame of fire; 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_15">15&#160;</span> And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_16">16&#160;</span> And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <span class='add'>was</span> as the sun shineth in his strength. 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_17">17&#160;</span> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_18">18&#160;</span> I <span class='add'>am</span> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV1_19">19&#160;</span> Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 
<span class="verse" id="RV1_20">20&#160;</span> The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV2_0'> 2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV2_1">1&#160;</span> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_2">2&#160;</span> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_3">3&#160;</span> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_4">4&#160;</span> Nevertheless I have <span class='add'>somewhat</span> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_5">5&#160;</span> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_6">6&#160;</span> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_7">7&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV2_8">8&#160;</span> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_9">9&#160;</span> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <span class='add'>I know</span> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <span class='add'>are</span> the synagogue of Satan. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_10">10&#160;</span> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <span class='add'>some</span> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_11">11&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV2_12">12&#160;</span> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_13">13&#160;</span> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <span class='add'>even</span> where Satan’s seat <span class='add'>is</span>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <span class='add'>was</span> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_14">14&#160;</span> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_15">15&#160;</span> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_16">16&#160;</span> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_17">17&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <span class='add'>it.</span> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV2_18">18&#160;</span> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <span class='add'>are</span> like fine brass; 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_19">19&#160;</span> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <span class='add'>to be</span> more than the first. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_20">20&#160;</span> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_21">21&#160;</span> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_22">22&#160;</span> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_23">23&#160;</span> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_24">24&#160;</span> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_25">25&#160;</span> But that which ye have <span class='add'>already</span> hold fast till I come. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_26">26&#160;</span> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_27">27&#160;</span> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_28">28&#160;</span> And I will give him the morning star. 
<span class="verse" id="RV2_29">29&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV3_0'> 3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV3_1">1&#160;</span> And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_2">2&#160;</span> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_3">3&#160;</span> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_4">4&#160;</span> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_5">5&#160;</span> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_6">6&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV3_7">7&#160;</span> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_8">8&#160;</span> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_9">9&#160;</span> Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_10">10&#160;</span> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_11">11&#160;</span> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_12">12&#160;</span> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <span class='add'>which is</span> new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and <span class='add'>I will write upon him</span> my new name. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_13">13&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV3_14">14&#160;</span> And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_15">15&#160;</span> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_16">16&#160;</span> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_17">17&#160;</span> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_18">18&#160;</span> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <span class='add'>that</span> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_19">19&#160;</span> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_20">20&#160;</span> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_21">21&#160;</span> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. 
<span class="verse" id="RV3_22">22&#160;</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV4_0'> 4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV4_1">1&#160;</span> After this I looked, and, behold, a door <span class='add'>was</span> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard <span class='add'>was</span> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_2">2&#160;</span> And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <span class='add'>one</span> sat on the throne. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_3">3&#160;</span> And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and <span class='add'>there was</span> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_4">4&#160;</span> And round about the throne <span class='add'>were</span> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_5">5&#160;</span> And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <span class='add'>there were</span> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_6">6&#160;</span> And before the throne <span class='add'>there was</span> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <span class='add'>were</span> four beasts full of eyes before and behind. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_7">7&#160;</span> And the first beast <span class='add'>was</span> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast <span class='add'>was</span> like a flying eagle. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_8">8&#160;</span> And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <span class='add'>him</span>; and <span class='add'>they were</span> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_9">9&#160;</span> And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_10">10&#160;</span> The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="RV4_11">11&#160;</span> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV5_0'> 5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV5_1">1&#160;</span> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_2">2&#160;</span> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_3">3&#160;</span> And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_4">4&#160;</span> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_5">5&#160;</span> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_6">6&#160;</span> And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_7">7&#160;</span> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_8">8&#160;</span> And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <span class='add'>and</span> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_9">9&#160;</span> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_10">10&#160;</span> And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_11">11&#160;</span> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_12">12&#160;</span> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_13">13&#160;</span> And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <span class='add'>be</span> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. 
<span class="verse" id="RV5_14">14&#160;</span> And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <span class='add'>and</span> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.  </div>
<div class='psalmlabel' id='RV6_0'> 6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="RV6_1">1&#160;</span> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_2">2&#160;</span> And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_3">3&#160;</span> And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_4">4&#160;</span> And there went out another horse <span class='add'>that was</span> red: and <span class='add'>power</span> was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_5">5&#160;</span> And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_6">6&#160;</span> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and <span class='add'>see</span> thou hurt not the oil and the wine. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_7">7&#160;</span> And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_8">8&#160;</span> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_9">9&#160;</span> And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_10">10&#160;</span> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_11">11&#160;</span> And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they <span class='add'>were</span>, should be fulfilled. 
<span class="verse" id="RV6_12">12&#160;</span> And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
