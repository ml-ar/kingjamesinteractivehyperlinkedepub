<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_2">2&#160;</span> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_3">3&#160;</span> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: <span class='add'>but</span> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_4">4&#160;</span> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_5">5&#160;</span>¶ Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_6">6&#160;</span> From the sole of the foot even unto the head <span class='add'>there is</span> no soundness in it; <span class='add'>but</span> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_7">7&#160;</span> Your country <span class='add'>is</span> desolate, your cities <span class='add'>are</span> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <span class='add'>it is</span> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_8">8&#160;</span> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_9">9&#160;</span> Except the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <span class='add'>and</span> we should have been like unto Gomorrah. </div>

<span class="verse" id="IS1_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Hear the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_11">11&#160;</span> To what purpose <span class='add'>is</span> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_12">12&#160;</span> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
<span class="verse" id="IS1_13">13&#160;</span> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <span class='add'>it is</span> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_14">14&#160;</span> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <span class='add'>them</span>.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_15">15&#160;</span> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_16">16&#160;</span>¶ Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
<span class="verse" id="IS1_17">17&#160;</span> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_18">18&#160;</span> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_19">19&#160;</span> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
<span class="verse" id="IS1_20">20&#160;</span> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_21">21&#160;</span>¶ How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_22">22&#160;</span> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
<span class="verse" id="IS1_23">23&#160;</span> Thy princes <span class='add'>are</span> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_24">24&#160;</span> Therefore saith the Lord, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_25">25&#160;</span>¶ And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
<span class="verse" id="IS1_26">26&#160;</span> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_27">27&#160;</span> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS1_28">28&#160;</span>¶ And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <span class='add'>shall be</span> together, and they that forsake the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall be consumed.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_29">29&#160;</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_30">30&#160;</span> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<span class="verse" id="IS1_31">31&#160;</span> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <span class='add'>them</span>.</div>

<span class="verse" id="IS2_1">1&#160;</span> The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_2">2&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass in the last days, <span class='add'>that</span> the mountain of the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_3">3&#160;</span> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> from Jerusalem.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_4">4&#160;</span> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_5">5&#160;</span> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="IS2_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <span class='add'>are</span> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_7">7&#160;</span> Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither <span class='add'>is there any</span> end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither <span class='add'>is there any</span> end of their chariots:
<span class="verse" id="IS2_8">8&#160;</span> Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

<span class="verse" id="IS2_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and for the glory of his majesty.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_11">11&#160;</span> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> alone shall be exalted in that day.
<span class="verse" id="IS2_12">12&#160;</span> For the day of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon every <span class='add'>one that is</span> proud and lofty, and upon every <span class='add'>one that is</span> lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

<span class="verse" id="IS2_20">20&#160;</span> In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made <span class='add'>each one</span> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
<span class="verse" id="IS2_21">21&#160;</span> To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

<span class="verse" id="IS3_7">7&#160;</span> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house <span class='add'>is</span> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

<span class="verse" id="IS66_12">12&#160;</span> For thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon <span class='add'>her</span> sides, and be dandled upon <span class='add'>her</span> knees.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_13">13&#160;</span> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_14">14&#160;</span> And when ye see <span class='add'>this</span>, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall be known toward his servants, and <span class='add'>his</span> indignation toward his enemies. </div>

<span class="verse" id="IS66_15">15&#160;</span> For, behold, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_16">16&#160;</span> For by fire and by his sword will the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> plead with all flesh: and the slain of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall be many.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_17">17&#160;</span> They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one <span class='add'>tree</span> in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_18">18&#160;</span>For I <span class='add'>know</span> their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_19">19&#160;</span> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <span class='add'>to</span> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <span class='add'>to</span> Tubal, and Javan, <span class='add'>to</span> the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_20">20&#160;</span> And they shall bring all your brethren <span class='add'>for</span> an offering unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_21">21&#160;</span> And I will also take of them for priests <span class='add'>and</span> for Levites, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_22">22&#160;</span> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_23">23&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
<span class="verse" id="IS66_24">24&#160;</span> And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. </div><div class="footnote">
