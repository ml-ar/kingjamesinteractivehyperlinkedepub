<span class="verse" id="SS1_1">1&#160;</span> The song of songs, which <span class='add'>is</span> Solomon’s. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="SS1_2">2&#160;</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <span class='add'>is</span> better than wine.
<span class="verse" id="SS1_3">3&#160;</span> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <span class='add'>is as</span> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. 
<span class="verse" id="SS1_4">4&#160;</span> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
<span class="verse" id="SS1_5">5&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>am</span> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 
<span class="verse" id="SS1_6">6&#160;</span> Look not upon me, because I <span class='add'>am</span> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; <span class='add'>but</span> mine own vineyard have I not kept. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="SS1_7">7&#160;</span> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest <span class='add'>thy flock</span> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="SS1_8">8&#160;</span>¶ If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. 
<span class="verse" id="SS1_9">9&#160;</span> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots. 
<span class="verse" id="SS1_10">10&#160;</span> Thy cheeks are comely with rows <span class='add'>of jewels</span>, thy neck with chains <span class='add'>of gold</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="SS1_11">11&#160;</span> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. </div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="SS2_14">14&#160;</span>¶ O my dove, <span class='add'>that art</span> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret <span class='add'>places</span> of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet <span class='add'>is</span> thy voice, and thy countenance <span class='add'>is</span> comely.
