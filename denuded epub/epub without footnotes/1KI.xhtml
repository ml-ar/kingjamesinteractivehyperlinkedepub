<div class='mt'>The First Book of the Kings </div>
<div class='mt2'>Commonly Called the Third Book of the Kings  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='K11_0'>1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="K11_1">1&#160;</span> Now king David was old <span class='add'>and</span> stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
<span class="verse" id="K11_2">2&#160;</span> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
<span class="verse" id="K11_3">3&#160;</span> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_4">4&#160;</span> And the damsel <span class='add'>was</span> very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_5">5&#160;</span>¶ Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
<span class="verse" id="K11_6">6&#160;</span> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also <span class='add'>was a</span> very goodly <span class='add'>man;</span> and <span class='add'>his mother</span> bare him after Absalom.
<span class="verse" id="K11_7">7&#160;</span> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped <span class='add'>him</span>.
<span class="verse" id="K11_8">8&#160;</span> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which <span class='add'>belonged</span> to David, were not with Adonijah. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_9">9&#160;</span> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which <span class='add'>is</span> by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:
<span class="verse" id="K11_10">10&#160;</span> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth <span class='add'>it</span> not? 
<span class="verse" id="K11_12">12&#160;</span> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_13">13&#160;</span> Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 
<span class="verse" id="K11_14">14&#160;</span> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_15">15&#160;</span>¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_16">16&#160;</span> And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
<span class="verse" id="K11_17">17&#160;</span> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God unto thine handmaid, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_18">18&#160;</span> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest <span class='add'>it</span> not: 
<span class="verse" id="K11_19">19&#160;</span> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_20">20&#160;</span> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <span class='add'>are</span> upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_21">21&#160;</span> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_22">22&#160;</span>¶ And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_23">23&#160;</span> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_24">24&#160;</span> And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
<span class="verse" id="K11_25">25&#160;</span> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
<span class="verse" id="K11_26">26&#160;</span>But me, <span class='add'>even</span> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_27">27&#160;</span> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed <span class='add'>it</span> unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_28">28&#160;</span>¶ Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
<span class="verse" id="K11_29">29&#160;</span> And the king sware, and said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
<span class="verse" id="K11_30">30&#160;</span> Even as I sware unto thee by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_31">31&#160;</span> Then Bath-sheba bowed with <span class='add'>her</span> face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_32">32&#160;</span>¶ And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_33">33&#160;</span> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
<span class="verse" id="K11_34">34&#160;</span> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_35">35&#160;</span> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_36">36&#160;</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of my lord the king say so <span class='add'>too</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_37">37&#160;</span> As the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_38">38&#160;</span> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_39">39&#160;</span> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_40">40&#160;</span> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_41">41&#160;</span>¶ And Adonijah and all the guests that <span class='add'>were</span> with him heard <span class='add'>it</span> as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore <span class='add'>is this</span> noise of the city being in an uproar? 
<span class="verse" id="K11_42">42&#160;</span> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_43">43&#160;</span> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_44">44&#160;</span> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule: 
<span class="verse" id="K11_45">45&#160;</span> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This <span class='add'>is</span> the noise that ye have heard. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_46">46&#160;</span> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_47">47&#160;</span> And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_48">48&#160;</span> And also thus said the king, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, which hath given <span class='add'>one</span> to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing <span class='add'>it</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_49">49&#160;</span> And all the guests that <span class='add'>were</span> with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K11_50">50&#160;</span>¶ And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_51">51&#160;</span> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_52">52&#160;</span> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. 
<span class="verse" id="K11_53">53&#160;</span> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='K12_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_1">1&#160;</span> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="K12_2">2&#160;</span> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 
<span class="verse" id="K12_3">3&#160;</span> And keep the charge of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
<span class="verse" id="K12_4">4&#160;</span> That the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
<span class="verse" id="K12_5">5&#160;</span> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, <span class='add'>and</span> what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that <span class='add'>was</span> about his loins, and in his shoes that <span class='add'>were</span> on his feet.
<span class="verse" id="K12_6">6&#160;</span> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_7">7&#160;</span> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_8">8&#160;</span>And, behold, <span class='add'>thou hast</span> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
<span class="verse" id="K12_9">9&#160;</span> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_10">10&#160;</span> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_11">11&#160;</span> And the days that David reigned over Israel <span class='add'>were</span> forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_12">12&#160;</span>¶ Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_13">13&#160;</span>¶ And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_14">14&#160;</span> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_15">15&#160;</span> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and <span class='add'>that</span> all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_16">16&#160;</span> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
<span class="verse" id="K12_17">17&#160;</span> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_18">18&#160;</span> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_19">19&#160;</span>¶ Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_20">20&#160;</span> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; <span class='add'>I pray thee</span>, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_21">21&#160;</span> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_22">22&#160;</span> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he <span class='add'>is</span> mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_23">23&#160;</span> Then king Solomon sware by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_24">24&#160;</span>Now therefore, <span class='add'>as</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_25">25&#160;</span> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_26">26&#160;</span>¶ And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou <span class='add'>art</span> worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord <span class='nd'>GOD</span> before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
<span class="verse" id="K12_27">27&#160;</span> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; that he might fulfil the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_28">28&#160;</span>¶ Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_29">29&#160;</span> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and, behold, <span class='add'>he is</span> by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_30">30&#160;</span> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_31">31&#160;</span> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_32">32&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing <span class='add'>thereof, to wit</span>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_33">33&#160;</span> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_34">34&#160;</span> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_35">35&#160;</span>¶ And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K12_36">36&#160;</span>¶ And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_37">37&#160;</span>For it shall be, <span class='add'>that</span> on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_38">38&#160;</span> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying <span class='add'>is</span> good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_39">39&#160;</span> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants <span class='add'>be</span> in Gath. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_40">40&#160;</span> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_41">41&#160;</span> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_42">42&#160;</span> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word <span class='add'>that</span> I have heard <span class='add'>is</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="K12_43">43&#160;</span> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? 
<span class="verse" id="K12_44">44&#160;</span> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 
<span class="verse" id="K12_45">45&#160;</span> And king Solomon <span class='add'>shall be</span> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> for ever.

<span class="verse" id="K13_27">27&#160;</span> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she <span class='add'>is</span> the mother thereof.

<span class="verse" id="K110_4">4&#160;</span> And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,

<span class="verse" id="K110_27">27&#160;</span> And the king made silver <span class='add'>to be</span> in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he <span class='add'>to be</span> as the sycomore trees that <span class='add'>are</span> in the vale, for abundance.</div>

<span class="verse" id="K111_34">34&#160;</span> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:

<span class="verse" id="K111_40">40&#160;</span> Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K111_41">41&#160;</span>¶ And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, <span class='add'>are</span> they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
<span class="verse" id="K111_42">42&#160;</span> And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel <span class='add'>was</span> forty years.
<span class="verse" id="K111_43">43&#160;</span> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</div>

<span class="verse" id="K112_1">1&#160;</span> And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_2">2&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
<span class="verse" id="K112_3">3&#160;</span> That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="K112_4">4&#160;</span> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_5">5&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Depart yet <span class='add'>for</span> three days, then come again to me. And the people departed. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K112_6">6&#160;</span>¶ And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
<span class="verse" id="K112_7">7&#160;</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_8">8&#160;</span> But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, <span class='add'>and</span> which stood before him: 
<span class="verse" id="K112_9">9&#160;</span> And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
<span class="verse" id="K112_10">10&#160;</span> And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou <span class='add'>it</span> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little <span class='add'>finger</span> shall be thicker than my father’s loins. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_11">11&#160;</span> And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K112_12">12&#160;</span>¶ So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_13">13&#160;</span> And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;
<span class="verse" id="K112_14">14&#160;</span> And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father <span class='add'>also</span> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_15">15&#160;</span> Wherefore the king hearkened  not unto the people; for the cause was from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that he might perform his saying, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K112_16">16&#160;</span>¶ So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither <span class='add'>have we</span> inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_17">17&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>as for</span> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_18">18&#160;</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who <span class='add'>was</span> over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
<span class="verse" id="K112_19">19&#160;</span> So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
<span class="verse" id="K112_20">20&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K112_21">21&#160;</span>¶ And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_22">22&#160;</span> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="K112_23">23&#160;</span> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="K112_24">24&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K112_25">25&#160;</span>¶ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_26">26&#160;</span> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 
<span class="verse" id="K112_27">27&#160;</span> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, <span class='add'>even</span> unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_28">28&#160;</span> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves <span class='add'>of</span> gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_29">29&#160;</span> And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_30">30&#160;</span> And this thing became a sin: for the people went <span class='add'>to worship</span> before the one, <span class='add'>even</span> unto Dan. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_31">31&#160;</span> And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
<span class="verse" id="K112_32">32&#160;</span> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that <span class='add'>is</span> in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
<span class="verse" id="K112_33">33&#160;</span> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, <span class='add'>even</span> in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='K113_0'>13</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K113_1">1&#160;</span> And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
<span class="verse" id="K113_2">2&#160;</span> And he cried against the altar in the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_3">3&#160;</span> And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This <span class='add'>is</span> the sign which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that <span class='add'>are</span> upon it shall be poured out. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_4">4&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_5">5&#160;</span> The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_6">6&#160;</span> And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as <span class='add'>it was</span> before.<span class='nd'></span><span class='nd'></span> 
<span class="verse" id="K113_7">7&#160;</span> And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K113_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_12">12&#160;</span> And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_13">13&#160;</span> And he said unto his sons, Saddle  me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, 
<span class="verse" id="K113_14">14&#160;</span> And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, <span class='add'>Art</span> thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I <span class='add'>am</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_15">15&#160;</span> Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

<span class="verse" id="K113_18">18&#160;</span> He said unto him, I <span class='add'>am</span> a prophet also as thou <span class='add'>art;</span> and an angel spake unto me by the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. <span class='add'>But</span> he lied unto him. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_19">19&#160;</span> So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. </div>

<span class="verse" id="K113_20">20&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came unto the prophet that brought him back:

<span class="verse" id="K113_22">22&#160;</span> But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which <span class='add'>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></span> did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K113_23">23&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, <span class='add'>to wit</span>, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_24">24&#160;</span> And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_25">25&#160;</span> And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told <span class='add'>it</span> in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
<span class="verse" id="K113_26">26&#160;</span> And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard <span class='add'>thereof</span>, he said, It <span class='add'>is</span> the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: therefore the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which he spake unto him.
<span class="verse" id="K113_27">27&#160;</span> And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled <span class='add'>him</span>.

<span class="verse" id="K113_31">31&#160;</span> And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God <span class='add'>is</span> buried; lay my bones beside his bones:

<span class="verse" id="K118_9">9&#160;</span> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
<span class="verse" id="K118_10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, <span class='add'>He is</span> not <span class='add'>there;</span> he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_11">11&#160;</span> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <span class='add'>is here</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>as soon as</span> I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall carry thee whither I know not; and <span class='add'>so</span> when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> from my youth. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_13">13&#160;</span> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, how I hid an hundred men of the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
<span class="verse" id="K118_14">14&#160;</span> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <span class='add'>is here:</span> and he shall slay me. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_15">15&#160;</span> And Elijah said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_16">16&#160;</span> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K118_17">17&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, <span class='add'>Art</span> thou he that troubleth Israel? 
<span class="verse" id="K118_18">18&#160;</span> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and thou hast followed Baalim. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_19">19&#160;</span> Now therefore send, <span class='add'>and</span> gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_20">20&#160;</span> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K118_21">21&#160;</span> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>be</span> God, follow him: but if Baal, <span class='add'>then</span> follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
<span class="verse" id="K118_22">22&#160;</span> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, <span class='add'>even</span> I only, remain a prophet of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; but Baal’s prophets <span class='add'>are</span> four hundred and fifty men. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_23">23&#160;</span> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay <span class='add'>it</span> on wood, and put no fire <span class='add'>under:</span> and I will dress the other bullock, and lay <span class='add'>it</span> on wood, and put no fire <span class='add'>under:</span> 
<span class="verse" id="K118_24">24&#160;</span> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
<span class="verse" id="K118_25">25&#160;</span> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress <span class='add'>it</span> first; for ye <span class='add'>are</span> many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire <span class='add'>under</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_26">26&#160;</span> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed <span class='add'>it</span>, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.

<span class="verse" id="K118_27">27&#160;</span> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he <span class='add'>is</span> a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, <span class='add'>or</span> peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
<span class="verse" id="K118_28">28&#160;</span> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
<span class="verse" id="K118_29">29&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the <span class='add'>time</span> of the offering of the <span class='add'>evening</span> sacrifice, that <span class='add'>there was</span> neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
<span class="verse" id="K118_30">30&#160;</span> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>that was</span> broken down. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_31">31&#160;</span> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
<span class="verse" id="K118_32">32&#160;</span> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_33">33&#160;</span> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid <span class='add'>him</span> on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour <span class='add'>it</span> on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_34">34&#160;</span> And he said, Do <span class='add'>it</span> the second time. And they did <span class='add'>it</span> the second time. And he said, Do <span class='add'>it</span> the third time. And they did <span class='add'>it</span> the third time. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_35">35&#160;</span> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
<span class="verse" id="K118_36">36&#160;</span>And it came to pass at <span class='add'>the time of</span> the offering of the <span class='add'>evening</span> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou <span class='add'>art</span> God in Israel, and <span class='add'>that</span> I <span class='add'>am</span> thy servant, and <span class='add'>that</span> I have done all these things at thy word. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_37">37&#160;</span> Hear me, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, hear me, that this people may know that thou <span class='add'>art</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God, and <span class='add'>that</span> thou hast turned their heart back again. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_38">38&#160;</span> Then the fire of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that <span class='add'>was</span> in the trench. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_39">39&#160;</span> And when all the people saw <span class='add'>it</span>, they fell on their faces: and they said, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, he <span class='add'>is</span> the God; the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, he <span class='add'>is</span> the God. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_40">40&#160;</span> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K118_41">41&#160;</span>¶ And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for <span class='add'>there is</span> a sound of abundance of rain.
<span class="verse" id="K118_42">42&#160;</span> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, 
<span class="verse" id="K118_43">43&#160;</span> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, <span class='add'>There is</span> nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_44">44&#160;</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand.

<span class="verse" id="K118_45">45&#160;</span> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 
<span class="verse" id="K118_46">46&#160;</span> And the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</div>

<span class="verse" id="K119_4">4&#160;</span>¶ But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, take away my life; for I <span class='add'>am</span> not better than my fathers.
<span class="verse" id="K119_5">5&#160;</span> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise <span class='add'>and</span> eat.

<span class="verse" id="K120_36">36&#160;</span> Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. 
<span class="verse" id="K120_37">37&#160;</span> Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded <span class='add'>him</span>.
<span class="verse" id="K120_38">38&#160;</span> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
<span class="verse" id="K120_39">39&#160;</span> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
<span class="verse" id="K120_40">40&#160;</span> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So <span class='add'>shall</span> thy judgment <span class='add'>be;</span> thyself hast decided <span class='add'>it</span>.
<span class="verse" id="K120_41">41&#160;</span> And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he <span class='add'>was</span> of the prophets. 
<span class="verse" id="K120_42">42&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Because thou hast let go out of <span class='add'>thy</span> hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
<span class="verse" id="K120_43">43&#160;</span> And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K121_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass after these things, <span class='add'>that</span> Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which <span class='add'>was</span> in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_2">2&#160;</span> And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <span class='add'>is</span> near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; <span class='add'>or</span>, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
<span class="verse" id="K121_3">3&#160;</span> And Naboth said to Ahab, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_4">4&#160;</span> And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K121_5">5&#160;</span>¶ But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
<span class="verse" id="K121_6">6&#160;</span> And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee <span class='add'>another</span> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_7">7&#160;</span> And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, <span class='add'>and</span> eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_8">8&#160;</span> So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed <span class='add'>them</span> with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that <span class='add'>were</span> in his city, dwelling  with Naboth. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_9">9&#160;</span> And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
<span class="verse" id="K121_10">10&#160;</span> And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And <span class='add'>then</span> carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_11">11&#160;</span> And the men of his city, <span class='add'>even</span> the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, <span class='add'>and</span> as it <span class='add'>was</span> written in the letters which she had sent unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_12">12&#160;</span> They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_14">14&#160;</span> Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K121_15">15&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_16">16&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. </div>

<span class="verse" id="K121_17">17&#160;</span>¶ And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

<span class="verse" id="K121_19">19&#160;</span> And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_20">20&#160;</span> And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found <span class='add'>thee:</span> because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_21">21&#160;</span> Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
<span class="verse" id="K121_22">22&#160;</span> And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked <span class='add'>me</span> to anger, and made Israel to sin. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_23">23&#160;</span> And of Jezebel also spake the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
<span class="verse" id="K121_24">24&#160;</span> Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="K121_25">25&#160;</span>¶ But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
<span class="verse" id="K121_26">26&#160;</span> And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all <span class='add'>things</span> as did the Amorites, whom the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> cast out before the children of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_27">27&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
<span class="verse" id="K121_28">28&#160;</span> And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

<span class="verse" id="K122_1">1&#160;</span> And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_2">2&#160;</span> And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_3">3&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead <span class='add'>is</span> ours, and we <span class='add'>be</span> still, <span class='add'>and</span> take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
<span class="verse" id="K122_4">4&#160;</span> And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I <span class='add'>am</span> as thou <span class='add'>art</span>, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_5">5&#160;</span> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to day. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_6">6&#160;</span> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

<span class="verse" id="K122_7">7&#160;</span> And Jehoshaphat said, <span class='add'>Is there</span> not here a prophet of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> besides, that we might enquire of him? 
<span class="verse" id="K122_8">8&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <span class='add'>There is</span> yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.

<span class="verse" id="K122_9">9&#160;</span> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten <span class='add'>hither</span> Micaiah the son of Imlah.
<span class="verse" id="K122_10">10&#160;</span> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<span class="verse" id="K122_11">11&#160;</span> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

<span class="verse" id="K122_13">13&#160;</span> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <span class='add'>declare</span> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak <span class='add'>that which is</span> good. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_14">14&#160;</span> And Micaiah said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saith unto me, that will I speak. </div>

<span class="verse" id="K122_15">15&#160;</span>¶ So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?

<span class="verse" id="K122_16">16&#160;</span> And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but <span class='add'>that which is</span> true in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>? 
<span class="verse" id="K122_17">17&#160;</span> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_18">18&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
<span class="verse" id="K122_19">19&#160;</span> And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: I saw the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sitting  on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_20">20&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
<span class="verse" id="K122_21">21&#160;</span> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, I will persuade him. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_22">22&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade <span class='add'>him</span>, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_23">23&#160;</span> Now therefore, behold, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken evil concerning thee.

<span class="verse" id="K122_25">25&#160;</span> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<span class="verse" id="K122_26">26&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;

<span class="verse" id="K122_29">29&#160;</span> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

<span class="verse" id="K122_31">31&#160;</span> But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_32">32&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it <span class='add'>is</span> the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
<span class="verse" id="K122_33">33&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it <span class='add'>was</span> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

<span class="verse" id="K122_36">36&#160;</span> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. </div>
