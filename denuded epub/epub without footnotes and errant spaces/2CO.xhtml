<div class='mt'>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C21_0'>1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="C21_1">1&#160;</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy <span class='add'>our</span> brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: 
<span class="verse" id="C21_2">2&#160;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> to you and peace from God our Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_3">3&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
<span class="verse" id="C21_4">4&#160;</span> Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_5">5&#160;</span> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_6">6&#160;</span> And whether we be afflicted, <span class='add'>it is</span> for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, <span class='add'>it is</span> for your consolation and salvation. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_7">7&#160;</span>And our hope of you <span class='add'>is</span> stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so <span class='add'>shall ye be</span> also of the consolation. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_8">8&#160;</span> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 
<span class="verse" id="C21_9">9&#160;</span> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
<span class="verse" id="C21_10">10&#160;</span> Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver <span class='add'>us</span>; 
<span class="verse" id="C21_11">11&#160;</span> Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift <span class='add'>bestowed</span> upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C21_12">12&#160;</span> For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_13">13&#160;</span> For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 
<span class="verse" id="C21_14">14&#160;</span> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also <span class='add'>are</span> ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C21_15">15&#160;</span> And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 
<span class="verse" id="C21_16">16&#160;</span> And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_17">17&#160;</span> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? 
<span class="verse" id="C21_18">18&#160;</span> But <span class='add'>as</span> God <span class='add'>is</span> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_19">19&#160;</span> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, <span class='add'>even</span> by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_20">20&#160;</span> For all the promises of God in him <span class='add'>are</span> yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_21">21&#160;</span> Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, <span class='add'>is</span> God; 
<span class="verse" id="C21_22">22&#160;</span> Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_23">23&#160;</span> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 
<span class="verse" id="C21_24">24&#160;</span> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C22_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C22_1">1&#160;</span> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_2">2&#160;</span> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 
<span class="verse" id="C22_3">3&#160;</span> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <span class='add'>the joy</span> of you all. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_4">4&#160;</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_5">5&#160;</span> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_6">6&#160;</span> Sufficient to such a man <span class='add'>is</span> this punishment, which <span class='add'>was inflicted</span> of many. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_7">7&#160;</span> So that contrariwise ye <span class='add'>ought</span> rather to forgive <span class='add'>him</span>, and comfort <span class='add'>him</span>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_8">8&#160;</span> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <span class='add'>your</span> love toward him. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_9">9&#160;</span> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_10">10&#160;</span> To whom ye forgive any thing, I <span class='add'>forgive</span> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <span class='add'>it</span>, for your sakes <span class='add'>forgave I it</span> in the person of Christ; 
<span class="verse" id="C22_11">11&#160;</span> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_12">12&#160;</span> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <span class='add'>preach</span> Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
<span class="verse" id="C22_13">13&#160;</span> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_14">14&#160;</span> Now thanks <span class='add'>be</span> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 
<span class="verse" id="C22_15">15&#160;</span> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
<span class="verse" id="C22_16">16&#160;</span> To the one <span class='add'>we are</span> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <span class='add'>is</span> sufficient for these things? 
<span class="verse" id="C22_17">17&#160;</span> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C23_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C23_1">1&#160;</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <span class='add'>others</span>, epistles of commendation to you, or <span class='add'>letters</span> of commendation from you? 
<span class="verse" id="C23_2">2&#160;</span> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 
<span class="verse" id="C23_3">3&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Forasmuch as ye are</span> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C23_4">4&#160;</span> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
<span class="verse" id="C23_5">5&#160;</span> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <span class='add'>is</span> of God; 
<span class="verse" id="C23_6">6&#160;</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_7">7&#160;</span> But if the ministration of death, written <span class='add'>and</span> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <span class='add'>glory</span> was to be done away: 
<span class="verse" id="C23_8">8&#160;</span> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
<span class="verse" id="C23_9">9&#160;</span> For if the ministration of condemnation <span class='add'>be</span> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_10">10&#160;</span> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_11">11&#160;</span> For if that which is done away <span class='add'>was</span> glorious, much more that which remaineth <span class='add'>is</span> glorious. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_12">12&#160;</span> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
<span class="verse" id="C23_13">13&#160;</span> And not as Moses, <span class='add'>which</span> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: 
<span class="verse" id="C23_14">14&#160;</span> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <span class='add'>vail</span> is done away in Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_15">15&#160;</span> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_16">16&#160;</span> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_17">17&#160;</span> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <span class='add'>is</span>, there <span class='add'>is</span> liberty. 
<span class="verse" id="C23_18">18&#160;</span> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <span class='add'>even</span> as by the Spirit of the Lord.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C24_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C24_1">1&#160;</span> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 
<span class="verse" id="C24_2">2&#160;</span> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_3">3&#160;</span> But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
<span class="verse" id="C24_4">4&#160;</span> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_5">5&#160;</span> For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_6">6&#160;</span> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to <span class='add'>give</span> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C24_7">7&#160;</span> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_8">8&#160;</span> <span class='add'>We are</span> troubled on every side, yet not distressed; <span class='add'>we are</span> perplexed, but not in despair; 
<span class="verse" id="C24_9">9&#160;</span> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
<span class="verse" id="C24_10">10&#160;</span> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_11">11&#160;</span> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_12">12&#160;</span> So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_13">13&#160;</span> We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
<span class="verse" id="C24_14">14&#160;</span> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present <span class='add'>us</span> with you. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_15">15&#160;</span> For all things <span class='add'>are</span> for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_16">16&#160;</span> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward <span class='add'>man</span> is renewed day by day. 
<span class="verse" id="C24_17">17&#160;</span> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <span class='add'>and</span> eternal weight of glory; 
<span class="verse" id="C24_18">18&#160;</span> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen <span class='add'>are</span> temporal; but the things which are not seen <span class='add'>are</span> eternal.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C25_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C25_1">1&#160;</span> For we know that if our earthly house of <span class='add'>this</span> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_2">2&#160;</span> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 
<span class="verse" id="C25_3">3&#160;</span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_4">4&#160;</span> For we that are in <span class='add'>this</span> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_5">5&#160;</span> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <span class='add'>is</span> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_6">6&#160;</span> Therefore <span class='add'>we are</span> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
<span class="verse" id="C25_7">7&#160;</span>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
<span class="verse" id="C25_8">8&#160;</span> We are confident, <span class='add'>I say</span>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_9">9&#160;</span> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_10">10&#160;</span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <span class='add'>done</span> in <span class='add'>his</span> body, according to that he hath done, whether <span class='add'>it be</span> good or bad. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C25_11">11&#160;</span> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_12">12&#160;</span> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <span class='add'>answer</span> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_13">13&#160;</span> For whether we be beside ourselves, <span class='add'>it is</span> to God: or whether we be sober, <span class='add'>it is</span> for your cause. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_14">14&#160;</span> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 
<span class="verse" id="C25_15">15&#160;</span> And <span class='add'>that</span> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_16">16&#160;</span> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <span class='add'>him</span> no more. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_17">17&#160;</span> Therefore if any man <span class='add'>be</span> in Christ, <span class='add'>he is</span> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_18">18&#160;</span> And all things <span class='add'>are</span> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
<span class="verse" id="C25_19">19&#160;</span> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_20">20&#160;</span> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <span class='add'>you</span> by us: we pray <span class='add'>you</span> in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. 
<span class="verse" id="C25_21">21&#160;</span> For he hath made him <span class='add'>to be</span> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C26_0'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C26_1">1&#160;</span> We then, <span class='add'>as</span> workers together <span class='add'>with him</span>, beseech <span class='add'>you</span> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 
<span class="verse" id="C26_2">2&#160;</span>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <span class='add'>is</span> the accepted time; behold, now <span class='add'>is</span> the day of salvation.) 
<span class="verse" id="C26_3">3&#160;</span> Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
<span class="verse" id="C26_4">4&#160;</span> But in all <span class='add'>things</span> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
<span class="verse" id="C26_5">5&#160;</span> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
<span class="verse" id="C26_6">6&#160;</span> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
<span class="verse" id="C26_7">7&#160;</span> By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
<span class="verse" id="C26_8">8&#160;</span> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <span class='add'>yet</span> true; 
<span class="verse" id="C26_9">9&#160;</span> As unknown, and <span class='add'>yet</span> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 
<span class="verse" id="C26_10">10&#160;</span> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <span class='add'>yet</span> possessing all things. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C26_11">11&#160;</span>O <span class='add'>ye</span> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. 
<span class="verse" id="C26_12">12&#160;</span> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
<span class="verse" id="C26_13">13&#160;</span> Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <span class='add'>my</span> children,) be ye also enlarged. 
<span class="verse" id="C26_14">14&#160;</span> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 
<span class="verse" id="C26_15">15&#160;</span> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 
<span class="verse" id="C26_16">16&#160;</span> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <span class='add'>them</span>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
<span class="verse" id="C26_17">17&#160;</span> Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <span class='add'>thing</span>; and I will receive you, 
<span class="verse" id="C26_18">18&#160;</span> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C27_0'>7</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C27_1">1&#160;</span> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C27_2">2&#160;</span> Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_3">3&#160;</span> I speak not <span class='add'>this</span> to condemn <span class='add'>you</span>: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with <span class='add'>you</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_4">4&#160;</span> Great <span class='add'>is</span> my boldness of speech toward you, great <span class='add'>is</span> my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_5">5&#160;</span> For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without <span class='add'>were</span> fightings, within <span class='add'>were</span> fears. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_6">6&#160;</span> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
<span class="verse" id="C27_7">7&#160;</span> And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_8">8&#160;</span> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though <span class='add'>it were</span> but for a season. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_9">9&#160;</span> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_10">10&#160;</span> For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_11">11&#160;</span> For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> clearing of yourselves, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> indignation, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> fear, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> vehement desire, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> zeal, yea, <span class='add'>what</span> revenge! In all <span class='add'>things</span> ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, <span class='add'>I did it</span> not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_13">13&#160;</span> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_14">14&#160;</span> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which <span class='add'>I made</span> before Titus, is found a truth. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_15">15&#160;</span> And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
<span class="verse" id="C27_16">16&#160;</span> I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all <span class='add'>things.</span>  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C28_0'>8</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C28_1">1&#160;</span> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 
<span class="verse" id="C28_2">2&#160;</span> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_3">3&#160;</span> For to <span class='add'>their</span> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <span class='add'>their</span> power <span class='add'>they were</span> willing of themselves; 
<span class="verse" id="C28_4">4&#160;</span> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <span class='add'>take upon us</span> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_5">5&#160;</span> And <span class='add'>this they did</span>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_6">6&#160;</span> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_7">7&#160;</span> Therefore, as ye abound in every <span class='add'>thing, in</span> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <span class='add'>in</span> all diligence, and <span class='add'>in</span> your love to us, <span class='add'>see</span> that ye abound in this grace also. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_8">8&#160;</span> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_9">9&#160;</span> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_10">10&#160;</span> And herein I give <span class='add'>my</span> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_11">11&#160;</span> Now therefore perform the doing <span class='add'>of it</span>; that as <span class='add'>there was</span> a readiness to will, so <span class='add'>there may be</span> a performance also out of that which ye have. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_12">12&#160;</span> For if there be first a willing mind, <span class='add'>it is</span> accepted according to that a man hath, <span class='add'>and</span> not according to that he hath not. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_13">13&#160;</span> For <span class='add'>I mean</span> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
<span class="verse" id="C28_14">14&#160;</span>But by an equality, <span class='add'>that</span> now at this time your abundance <span class='add'>may be a supply</span> for their want, that their abundance also may be <span class='add'>a supply</span> for your want: that there may be equality: 
<span class="verse" id="C28_15">15&#160;</span> As it is written, He that <span class='add'>had gathered</span> much had nothing over; and he that <span class='add'>had gathered</span> little had no lack. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_16">16&#160;</span> But thanks <span class='add'>be</span> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_17">17&#160;</span> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_18">18&#160;</span> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <span class='add'>is</span> in the gospel throughout all the churches; 
<span class="verse" id="C28_19">19&#160;</span> And not <span class='add'>that</span> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <span class='add'>declaration of</span> your ready mind: 
<span class="verse" id="C28_20">20&#160;</span> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
<span class="verse" id="C28_21">21&#160;</span> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_22">22&#160;</span> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <span class='add'>I have</span> in you. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_23">23&#160;</span> Whether <span class='add'>any do enquire</span> of Titus, <span class='add'>he is</span> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <span class='add'>be enquired of, they are</span> the messengers of the churches, <span class='add'>and</span> the glory of Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C28_24">24&#160;</span> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C29_0'>9</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C29_1">1&#160;</span> For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
<span class="verse" id="C29_2">2&#160;</span> For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_3">3&#160;</span> Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
<span class="verse" id="C29_4">4&#160;</span> Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_5">5&#160;</span> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as <span class='add'>a matter of</span> bounty, and not as <span class='add'>of</span> covetousness. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_6">6&#160;</span> But this <span class='add'>I say</span>, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_7">7&#160;</span> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <span class='add'>so let him give</span>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_8">8&#160;</span> And God <span class='add'>is</span> able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all <span class='add'>things</span>, may abound to every good work: 
<span class="verse" id="C29_9">9&#160;</span>(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_10">10&#160;</span> Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for <span class='add'>your</span> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) 
<span class="verse" id="C29_11">11&#160;</span> Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_12">12&#160;</span> For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
<span class="verse" id="C29_13">13&#160;</span> Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for <span class='add'>your</span> liberal distribution unto them, and unto all <span class='add'>men</span>; 
<span class="verse" id="C29_14">14&#160;</span> And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. 
<span class="verse" id="C29_15">15&#160;</span> Thanks <span class='add'>be</span> unto God for his unspeakable gift.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C210_0'>10</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C210_1">1&#160;</span> Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <span class='add'>am</span> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: 
<span class="verse" id="C210_2">2&#160;</span> But I beseech <span class='add'>you</span>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_3">3&#160;</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
<span class="verse" id="C210_4">4&#160;</span>(For the weapons of our warfare <span class='add'>are</span> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
<span class="verse" id="C210_5">5&#160;</span> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
<span class="verse" id="C210_6">6&#160;</span> And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_7">7&#160;</span> Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <span class='add'>is</span> Christ’s, even so <span class='add'>are</span> we Christ’s. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_8">8&#160;</span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 
<span class="verse" id="C210_9">9&#160;</span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_10">10&#160;</span> For <span class='add'>his</span> letters, say they, <span class='add'>are</span> weighty and powerful; but <span class='add'>his</span> bodily presence <span class='add'>is</span> weak, and <span class='add'>his</span> speech contemptible. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_11">11&#160;</span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <span class='add'>will we be</span> also in deed when we are present. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_12">12&#160;</span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_13">13&#160;</span> But we will not boast of things without <span class='add'>our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_14">14&#160;</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond <span class='add'>our measure</span>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <span class='add'>preaching</span> the gospel of Christ: 
<span class="verse" id="C210_15">15&#160;</span> Not boasting of things without <span class='add'>our</span> measure, <span class='add'>that is</span>, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
<span class="verse" id="C210_16">16&#160;</span> To preach the gospel in the <span class='add'>regions</span> beyond you, <span class='add'>and</span> not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_17">17&#160;</span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
<span class="verse" id="C210_18">18&#160;</span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C211_0'>11</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C211_1">1&#160;</span> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <span class='add'>my</span> folly: and indeed bear with me. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_2">2&#160;</span> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <span class='add'>you as</span> a chaste virgin to Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_3">3&#160;</span> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_4">4&#160;</span> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <span class='add'>if</span> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <span class='add'>him</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_5">5&#160;</span> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_6">6&#160;</span> But though <span class='add'>I be</span> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_7">7&#160;</span> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
<span class="verse" id="C211_8">8&#160;</span> I robbed other churches, taking wages <span class='add'>of them</span>, to do you service. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_9">9&#160;</span> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <span class='add'>things</span> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <span class='add'>so</span> will I keep <span class='add'>myself</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_10">10&#160;</span> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_11">11&#160;</span> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_12">12&#160;</span> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_13">13&#160;</span> For such <span class='add'>are</span> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_14">14&#160;</span> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_15">15&#160;</span> Therefore <span class='add'>it is</span> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C211_16">16&#160;</span> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

<span class="verse" id="C211_18">18&#160;</span> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_19">19&#160;</span> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <span class='add'>yourselves</span> are wise. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_20">20&#160;</span> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <span class='add'>you</span>, if a man take <span class='add'>of you</span>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 
<span class="verse" id="C211_21">21&#160;</span> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

<span class="verse" id="C212_1">1&#160;</span> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.

<span class="verse" id="C212_4">4&#160;</span> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

<span class="verse" id="C212_7">7&#160;</span> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

<span class="verse" id="C212_21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <span class='add'>that</span> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='C213_0'>13</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C213_1">1&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>is</span> the third <span class='add'>time</span> I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_2">2&#160;</span> I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: 
<span class="verse" id="C213_3">3&#160;</span> Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_4">4&#160;</span> For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_5">5&#160;</span> Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
<span class="verse" id="C213_6">6&#160;</span> But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_7">7&#160;</span> Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_8">8&#160;</span> For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_9">9&#160;</span> For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, <span class='add'>even</span> your perfection. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_10">10&#160;</span> Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C213_11">11&#160;</span> Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_12">12&#160;</span> Greet one another with an holy kiss. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="C213_13">13&#160;</span> All the saints salute you. 
<span class="verse" id="C213_14">14&#160;</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, <span class='add'>be</span> with you all. Amen. </div>
