<span class="verse" id="ZC1_1">1&#160;</span> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_2">2&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath been sore displeased with your fathers.
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_3">3&#160;</span> Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_4">4&#160;</span> Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and <span class='add'>from</span> your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_5">5&#160;</span> Your fathers, where <span class='add'>are</span> they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_6">6&#160;</span> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_7">7&#160;</span>¶ Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which <span class='add'>is</span> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_8">8&#160;</span> I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that <span class='add'>were</span> in the bottom; and behind him <span class='add'>were there</span> red horses, speckled, and white.
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_9">9&#160;</span> Then said I, O my lord, what <span class='add'>are</span> these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these <span class='add'>be</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_10">10&#160;</span> And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These <span class='add'>are they</span> whom the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_11">11&#160;</span> And they answered the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_12">12&#160;</span>¶ Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> answered and said, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_13">13&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> answered the angel that talked with me <span class='add'>with</span> good words <span class='add'>and</span> comfortable words. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_14">14&#160;</span> So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_15">15&#160;</span> And I am very sore displeased with the heathen <span class='add'>that are</span> at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_16">16&#160;</span> Therefore thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_17">17&#160;</span> Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_19">19&#160;</span> And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What <span class='add'>be</span> these? And he answered me, These <span class='add'>are</span> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_20">20&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shewed me four carpenters. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC1_21">21&#160;</span> Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These <span class='add'>are</span> the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up <span class='add'>their</span> horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_1">1&#160;</span> I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_2">2&#160;</span> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what <span class='add'>is</span> the breadth thereof, and what <span class='add'>is</span> the length thereof. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_3">3&#160;</span> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_4">4&#160;</span> And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited <span class='add'>as</span> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_5">5&#160;</span> For I, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_6">6&#160;</span>¶ Ho, ho, <span class='add'>come forth</span>, and flee from the land of the north, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_7">7&#160;</span> Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest <span class='add'>with</span> the daughter of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_8">8&#160;</span> For thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_9">9&#160;</span> For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath sent me. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_10">10&#160;</span>¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_11">11&#160;</span> And many nations shall be joined to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_12">12&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC2_13">13&#160;</span> Be silent, O all flesh, before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_1">1&#160;</span> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_2">2&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Satan, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> rebuke thee, O Satan; even the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <span class='add'>is</span> not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_3">3&#160;</span> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_4">4&#160;</span> And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_5">5&#160;</span> And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stood by. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_6">6&#160;</span> And the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> protested unto Joshua, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_7">7&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_8">8&#160;</span> Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <span class='add'>are</span> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_9">9&#160;</span> For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <span class='add'>shall be</span> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC3_10">10&#160;</span> In that day, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_1">1&#160;</span> And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_2">2&#160;</span> And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <span class='add'>of</span> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <span class='add'>are</span> upon the top thereof:
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_3">3&#160;</span> And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <span class='add'>side</span> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <span class='add'>side</span> thereof. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_4">4&#160;</span> So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <span class='add'>are</span> these, my lord? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_5">5&#160;</span> Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_6">6&#160;</span> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <span class='add'>is</span> the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts.
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_7">7&#160;</span>Who <span class='add'>art</span> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <span class='add'>thou shalt become</span> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <span class='add'>thereof with</span> shoutings, <span class='add'>crying</span>, Grace, grace unto it. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_8">8&#160;</span> Moreover the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came unto me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_9">9&#160;</span> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_10">10&#160;</span> For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <span class='add'>with</span> those seven; they <span class='add'>are</span> the eyes of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<span class='nd'></span><a href='#FN15' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>**</a> </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_11">11&#160;</span>¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What <span class='add'>are</span> these two olive trees upon the right <span class='add'>side</span> of the candlestick and upon the left <span class='add'>side</span> thereof? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_12">12&#160;</span> And I answered again, and said unto him, What <span class='add'>be these</span> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <span class='add'>oil</span> out of themselves?
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_13">13&#160;</span> And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <span class='add'>be</span>? And I said, No, my lord. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC4_14">14&#160;</span> Then said he, These <span class='add'>are</span> the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC5_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_1">1&#160;</span> Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_2">2&#160;</span> And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof <span class='add'>is</span> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_3">3&#160;</span> Then said he unto me, This <span class='add'>is</span> the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off <span class='add'>as</span> on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off <span class='add'>as</span> on that side according to it.
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_4">4&#160;</span> I will bring it forth, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_5">5&#160;</span>¶ Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what <span class='add'>is</span> this that goeth forth. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_6">6&#160;</span> And I said, What <span class='add'>is</span> it? And he said, This <span class='add'>is</span> an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This <span class='add'>is</span> their resemblance through all the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_7">7&#160;</span> And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this <span class='add'>is</span> a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_8">8&#160;</span> And he said, This <span class='add'>is</span> wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_9">9&#160;</span> Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind <span class='add'>was</span> in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_10">10&#160;</span> Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC5_11">11&#160;</span> And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC6_0'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_1">1&#160;</span> And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <span class='add'>were</span> mountains of brass. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_2">2&#160;</span> In the first chariot <span class='add'>were</span> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_3">3&#160;</span> And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_4">4&#160;</span> Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <span class='add'>are</span> these, my lord? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_5">5&#160;</span> And the angel answered and said unto me, These <span class='add'>are</span> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_6">6&#160;</span> The black horses which <span class='add'>are</span> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_7">7&#160;</span> And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_8">8&#160;</span> Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_9">9&#160;</span>¶ And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came unto me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_10">10&#160;</span> Take of <span class='add'>them of</span> the captivity, <span class='add'>even</span> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_11">11&#160;</span> Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <span class='add'>them</span> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_12">12&#160;</span> And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <span class='add'>is</span> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>:
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_13">13&#160;</span> Even he shall build the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_14">14&#160;</span> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC6_15">15&#160;</span>And they <span class='add'>that are</span> far off shall come and build in the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and ye shall know that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath sent me unto you.

<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC7_0'>7</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <span class='add'>that</span> the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came unto Zechariah in the fourth <span class='add'>day</span> of the ninth month, <span class='add'>even</span> in Chisleu; 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_2">2&#160;</span> When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>,
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_3">3&#160;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> to speak unto the priests which <span class='add'>were</span> in the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_4">4&#160;</span>¶ Then came the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts unto me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_5">5&#160;</span> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <span class='add'>month</span>, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <span class='add'>even</span> to me? 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_6">6&#160;</span> And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <span class='add'>for yourselves</span>, and drink <span class='add'>for yourselves</span>?
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_7">7&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Should ye</span> not <span class='add'>hear</span> the words which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <span class='add'>men</span> inhabited the south and the plain?</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_8">8&#160;</span>¶ And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came unto Zechariah, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_9">9&#160;</span> Thus speaketh the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_10">10&#160;</span> And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_11">11&#160;</span> But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_12">12&#160;</span> Yea, they made their hearts <span class='add'>as</span> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts.
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_13">13&#160;</span>Therefore it is come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts: 
<span class="verse" id="ZC7_14">14&#160;</span> But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='ZC8_0'>8</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="ZC8_1">1&#160;</span> Again the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts came <span class='add'>to me</span>, saying,
