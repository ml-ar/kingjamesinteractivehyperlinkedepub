This folder is the innards of the original epub (sha256 hash: c46df1ac65a2716ef907ba855a0e6d6ab48161d134e44f716421bbecb06e9659) but the the footnotes, jesus tags, and errant spaces of the original epub have been scrubbed.

Also modified SIRACH so that there's a period after the header of the first prologue (this aids in inserting footnotes)

Also modified 1 Esdras 9:49, changing errant period to comma

Tobit 3:10: When, not Whe 

Judith 13:2: Lying along, not lying alone

1 Macabees 9:50: Bethel, not Beth-el

2 Maccabees 11:1: Change "not long after the" to "not long after this"
